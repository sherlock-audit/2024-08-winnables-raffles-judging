# `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` can get the wrong winner

### Summary

The `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` can pick the wrong winner when called as the function cannot get the range of token that an owner have.

### Root Cause

- The `while (_ticketOwnership[id][ticketId] == address(0))` loop assumes that when the token has address(0), the owner is the closest ticketId owner before it. There is a chance that the ticket has no owner actually https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L93.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The tickets are not all sold

### External pre-conditions

1. The function needs to be called

### Attack Path

1. The function `ownerOf` is called
2. The function returns the winner based on the algorithm
3. Turns out that the token does not have an owner. 

### Impact

- The raffle can pick the wrong winner
