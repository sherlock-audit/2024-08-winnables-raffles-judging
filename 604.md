# Function "_SendETH" will not be able to send ETH to the relevant account.

### Summary

"_SendETH" will not be able to send ETH to the relevant account as the function or the account parameter is not made payable. Thus result in no ETH sent or transfered.

### Root Cause

In WinnablesTicketManager.sol:[Line483] there's a function called _sendETH. This function is intended to send ETH to an account and handles error cases. Without the payables keyword attached the function itself or the account address, the account will not be able to receive some ETH. This will affect all the functions that have _SendETH in it.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Intended receipients will not be able to get their ETH. This breaks one of your principles/invariants "Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded"

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Here's the mitigation to the cause:

```diff
+ function _sendETH(uint256 amount, address to) internal {
+        if (amount == 0) revert NothingToSend();
+        (bool success, ) = payable(to).call{ value: amount }("");
+        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
+    }

-function _sendETH(uint256 amount, address to) internal {
-        if (amount == 0) revert NothingToSend();
-        (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
-        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
-    }
```
