# hardcode empty `extraArgs` argument value in `BaseCCipSender.sol` contract

## Summary
hardcode empty `extraArgs` argument value in `BaseCCipSender.sol` contract  

## Vulnerability Detail
the chainlink CCIP documents specifies in documentation that `extraArgs` MUST not be hardcoded to behave accordingly 

> **Do not hardcode extraArgs**
>To simplify this example, extraArgs are hardcoded in the contract. For production deployments, make sure that extraArgs >is mutable. This allows you to build it offchain and pass it in a call to a function or store it in a variable that you > can update on-demand. This makes extraArgs compatible with future CCIP upgrades.

and 

> The extraArgs specifies the gasLimit for relaying the message to the recipient contract on the destination blockchain. In this example, the gasLimit is set to 0 because the contract only transfers tokens and does not expect function calls on the destination blockchain.


and if we look at `extraArgs` argument value in `BaseCCipSender.sol` 

```solidity
        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
            receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
            data: data,
            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
            extraArgs: "",
            feeToken: LINK_TOKEN
        });
```

`extraArgs: "",` is hardcode and empty

as later i talked with the sponsor, he told "when we were on 1.0 they said "The documentation says to have the CCIP Router as immutable but we recommend you make it mutable because it might change", then when they migrated to 1.2 they told us "now you can make it immutable because it won't change
hahah"

usually, users fill in the EVMExtraArgsV1 struct and then encode it to bytes using the _argsToBytes function but the point here not that point is that argument being hardcoded which is prohibited by chainlink team 

## Impact
will cause misbehaves in service in upgrades of the chainlink CCIP and not being able to pass it off-chain both due to being hardcoded

```solidity 

function _sendCCIPMessage(
        address ccipDestAddress,
        uint64 ccipDestChainSelector,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
        if (ccipDestAddress == address(0) || ccipDestChainSelector == uint64(0)) {
            revert MissingCCIPParams();
        }

        // Send CCIP message to the desitnation contract
        IRouterClient router = IRouterClient(CCIP_ROUTER);
        LinkTokenInterface linkToken = LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN);

        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
            receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
            data: data,
            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
            extraArgs: "",
            feeToken: LINK_TOKEN
        });

        uint256 fee = router.getFee(
            ccipDestChainSelector,
            message
        );
        uint256 currentLinkBalance = linkToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (fee > currentLinkBalance) {
            revert InsufficientLinkBalance(currentLinkBalance, fee);
        }

        messageId = router.ccipSend(
            ccipDestChainSelector,
            message
        );
    }

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- consider modifying this `extraArgs`: to the point its not hardcoded and always gets input to act accordingly
