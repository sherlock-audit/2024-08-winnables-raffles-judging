# CCIP upgrade will DoS sending messages making prizes and `ETH` stuck

### Summary

[BaseCCIPSender::_sendCCIPMessage()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPSender.sol#L32) forwards an empty `extraArgs` to the router, which is will not be compatible with a CCIP upgrade and will lead to stuck prizes and `ETH`, as [WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) and [WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334) will revert when sending the message, which is [unacceptable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles-0xsimao/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-please-discuss-any-design-choices-you-made):
> Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded

### Root Cause

In `BaseCCIPSender:32` `extraArgs` is null. [Check](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/getting-started#sending-data) the best practices to confirm Chainlink may upgrade and DoS the `Winnables` contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. CCIP upgrade.

### Attack Path

1. A raffle is canceled or a winner is drawn.
2. `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` and `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` revert, leading to stuck prizes and `ETH`.

### Impact

Stuck prizes and ETH.

### PoC

```solidity
function _sendCCIPMessage(
    ...
) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
    ...
    Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
        receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
        data: data,
        tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
        extraArgs: "",
        feeToken: LINK_TOKEN
    });
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

Set a mutable `extraArgs` argument that can be changed by the admin with a timelock.
