# abi.encodePacked will affect the uri function

### Summary

abi.encodePacked() should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function. This will result in unintended results when returned

### Root Cause

In WinnablesTicket.sol [Line: 57] abi.enCodeHacked() is used to encode 2 string arguments. This may result in a hash collision as the encoding is not padded to 32bytes.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The uri function may be impacted as it will return an unexpected result due to using abi.Encode pack. This also means that there won't be an ability to decode the uri function return should there be a need for it. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The mitigation for this would be to use either abi.Encode() or bytes.concact() since the arguments are strings.
