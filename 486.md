# Missing validation for `KEY_HASH` and `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` could lead to stuck raffle

## Summary
The `KEY_HASH` and `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` are initialized in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract via the constructor. However, there is no validation checks to ensure that the inputs for `KEY_HASH` and `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` are correct. If the inputs are incorrect, `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner` cannot execute and the raffle will  be stuck. Further, it cannot be cancelled if `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is reached. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the below code extract, we see that there are missing validations to ensure the accuracy of `KEY_HASH` and `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`. 

```solidity
constructor(
        address _linkToken,
        address _vrfCoordinator,
        uint64 _subscriptionId,
        bytes32 _keyHash,
        address _tickets,
        address _ccipRouter
    ) VRFConsumerBaseV2(_vrfCoordinator) BaseCCIPContract(_ccipRouter) BaseLinkConsumer(_linkToken) {
        VRF_COORDINATOR = _vrfCoordinator;
        SUBSCRIPTION_ID = _subscriptionId;
        KEY_HASH = _keyHash;
        TICKETS_CONTRACT = _tickets;
        _setRole(msg.sender, 0, true); // Deployer is admin by default
        LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, type(uint256).max);
    }
```

It is critical for these inputs to be correct, otherwise `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner` cannot execute as incorrect inputs will prevent the oracle from actually supplying a random value to determine the raffle result. 

Note that `keyHash` is not validated within the `VRFCoordinatorV2.sol` [contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/00f9c6e41f843f96108cdaa118a6ca740b11df35/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L407-L409).

```solidity
function drawWinner(uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        _checkShouldDraw(raffleId);
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.REQUESTED;

        uint256 requestId = VRFCoordinatorV2Interface(VRF_COORDINATOR).requestRandomWords(
            KEY_HASH,
            SUBSCRIPTION_ID,
            3,
            100_000,
            1
        );
        _chainlinkRequests[requestId] = RequestStatus({
            raffleId: raffleId,
            randomWord: 0
        });
        raffle.chainlinkRequestId = requestId;
        emit RequestSent(requestId, raffleId);
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

Further, in the event that this happens and the `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is reached, the raffle cannot be cancelled and effectively the assets are stuck. 

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```

## Impact

Incorrect inputs would prevent the oracle from actually supplying a random value to determine the raffle result, causing the raffle to be stuck. Further, in the event that `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is reached, the raffle cannot be cancelled and the assets are stuck. 

These validation checks should be included especially on the understanding that the winnables team intend to eventually allow any users to use their platform to raffle out their assets - see the [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12kGD8nJ9DiR0cW5ngT8A6gE7GBG7NwiDCOIkGksL8qY/edit) and extracted quote below: 

_"At launch only Winnables can create raffles but in the future we want to allow partners, then potentially any user to raffle out assets they may be holding and decide on the terms of the raffle."_
