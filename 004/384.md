# Insufficient validation of `minTicketsThreshold` and `maxTicketSupply` in `creatRaffle`

## Summary
Raffles can exist where that will never meet the draw condition due to insufficient checks in `createRaffle`.

## Vulnerability Detail
An undesirable and avoidable state will always be reached where Raffle cannot be drawn whenever 
`minTicketsThreshold` > `maxTicketSupplies` .
which can be easily prevented. Users cannot buy tickets when `raffle.maxTicketSupply` is exceeded so it is the rate-defining variable here. setting a `minTicketsThreshold` > `maxTicketSupply`  just means Raffle creator is starting the raffle with no intention of drawing winners.



## Impact
`Some Raffles will never meet the draw condition` 
Users will purchase tickets for a raffle but winners won't be drawn due to configuration in createRaffle,  they may be refunded but the expense for that raffle is laid to waste.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Raffle should ideally end whenever the `maxTicketSupply` is reached or when the `minTicketThreshold` is reached, however once tickets are exhausted the raffle is concluded. add this check during raffleCreation
`minTicketsThreshold <= maxTicketsSupply`
