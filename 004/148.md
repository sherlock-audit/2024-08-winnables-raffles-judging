# M-01 Missing Check for Minimum Tickets in `createRaffle` Function

### Summary

The lack of a check for `minTickets == 0` in the `createRaffle` function will cause potential operational issues as an admin could inadvertently set up a raffle that does not require any ticket sales before the raffle can be completed, leading to unexpected behavior or failed operations in the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `createRaffle` function, the `minTickets` parameter is not checked for a value of 0, which may allow for the creation of a raffle that requires zero tickets to be sold before drawing a winner.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `createRaffle()` with `minTickets` set to `0`.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `createRaffle()` with `minTickets` set to `0`.
2. The raffle is created without requiring any tickets to be sold.
3. The raffle may proceed without any participants and requiring the minimum tickets to be 0.

### Impact

The protocol could experience logical inconsistencies, such as a raffle drawing a winner without ticket sales, or this condition could be exploited to bypass intended restrictions on raffle operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `createRaffle` function to ensure that `minTickets > 0`.

```solidity
if (minTickets == 0) revert RaffleRequiresMinimumTickets();
```
