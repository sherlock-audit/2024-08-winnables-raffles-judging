# Missing validation on minTickets and maxTickets in createRaffle function

### Summary

The missing check `minTickets` <= `maxTickets` in `createRaffle` function of `WinablesTickerManager.sol` contract will cause all raffles with minTickets > maxTickets to have their prizes permanently locked on Ethereum and also not be refunded to players on Avalanche.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The missing check above allows the admin to successfully create raffles where minTickets is greater than maxTickets

### Impact

Without this constraint check, although the raffle is still successfully created, the player can still purchase tickets normally, but after the ticket purchase stage ends, the raffle cannot move to the draw winner step, which leads to the inability to propagate the winner to `WinablesPrizeManager`, as well as the inability to cancel the raffle. As a result, the prize will be permanently locked on `WinablesPrizeManager`, while `WinablesTicketManager` cannot refund the players.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a constraint between `minTickets` and `maxTickets` to ensure that `minTickets` <= `maxTickets`
