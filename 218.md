# `safeTransfer()` will not work for tokens like USDT

## Summary
`safeTransfer()` is used for transferring the rewards of winner. However this will not work for some tokens like USDT, which will result in a loss for users
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function [claimPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105), if the raffle type is TOKEN, the reward is sent to the winner by _sendTokenPrize():
```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
In the function `_sendTokenPrize()`, `safeTransfer` is used, which is a good practice in terms of adding a layer of safety by checking the return value .
```solidity
 function _sendTokenPrize(address token, uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(winner, amount);
    }
```
 However `safeTransfer` will not work for some tokens that the protocol intents to use. `safeTransfer` checks whether the data returned from the call is empty. If it's empty and the call didnâ€™t revert, it assumes that the transfer was successful. That is exactly the case with USDT, since USDT transfer returns void instead of a success boolean. Considering the protocol obviously states that USDT+USDC will be used, and the CLAIMED will be set to the status of the winner in the `claimPrize()`(Assuming the function is fixed: Navigato to my [previous sub](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles-oxwhite/issues/1)), users will end up losing their reward.
## Impact
Users will face a loss.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
I would recommend to put additional check like implementing balanceBefore/After of  the winner to verify  winner's balance has actually increased by the expected amount
