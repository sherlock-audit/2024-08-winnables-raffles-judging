# fulfillRandomWords must not revert

## Summary
The `fulfillRandomWords` function must not revert because the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time, which could block the selection of the winner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Regarding the documentation of VRF, [the fulfillRandomWords function must not revert](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert
).

If `raffle.status != RaffleStatus.REQUESTED`, the `fulfillRandomWords` function will revert with a `RequestNotFound` error, which will block future calls from the VRF service. As a result, the winner selection for the specific raffle will be blocked and the core functionality of the protocol will be hindered.

## Impact
The winner selection for the specific raffle will be blocked.

## Recommendation
Ensure that your contract logic does not revert; instead of reverting, simply break the incoming call.
