# VRFCoordination minimum confirmation change will DoS randomness requests leading to stuck prizes and ETH

### Summary

The block confirmations argument in [WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L310) is hardcoded to `3`, which may be less than the `s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations` in the VRF coordination. This will make `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()` revert, so the raffle can neither be claimed nor canceled.

This may happen because the VRF [coordinator](https://vscode.blockscan.com/ethereum/0x271682DEB8C4E0901D1a1550aD2e64D568E69909) has a function to change the minimum request confirmations `setConfig()`, line 230.

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicketManager:318`, `requestConfirmations` is hardcoded to `3`. In the [VRF coordinator](https://vscode.blockscan.com/ethereum/0x271682DEB8C4E0901D1a1550aD2e64D568E69909), line 390, it checks `requestConfirmations < s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations`, which may revert if `s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations > 3`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

`s_config.minimumRequestConfirmations` is changed by Chainlink.

### Attack Path

1. Enough tickets are bought in a raffle.
2. Chainlink modifies the minimum number of block confirmations to a value above 3.
3. `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()` reverts.

### Impact

Stuck ETH and prizes.

### PoC

The informations above can be confirmed with the links.

### Mitigation

Get the minimum number of block confirmations from the config in `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()` and send it if smaller than `3`.
