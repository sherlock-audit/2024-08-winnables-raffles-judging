# setRole function adds role on every call to user irrespective of passed status.

## Summary
`_setRole` function in Roles contract adds role to the user when it should be revoked.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_setRole` function should add a role to the user if status bool is True and revoke a role to the user if status bool is False. But the function is adding role to the user irrespective of the passed status bool value.

```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        // @audit-issue adding role irrespective of status
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```

Also in contest README it is mentioned that Role 0 should be able to grant or revoke roles. But due to the above mentioned issue roles cannot be revoked.

> Role 0 is an admin role and it allows its members to grant or deny roles to other users.

## Impact
User role will not be revoked when admin try to revoke a role to a user.
