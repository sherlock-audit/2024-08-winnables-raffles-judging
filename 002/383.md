# Since the status parameter is not used, this will result in the owner being unable to set the permission of any address to false.

### Summary

Since the status parameter is not used, this will result in the owner being unable to set the permission of any address to false.

### Root Cause

In [Role.sol:29](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L33), the status parameter is not used. Regardless of whether this parameter is true or false, the function treats it as true.

### Internal pre-conditions

The administrator wants to revoke permissions from an address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will prevent administrators from revoking permissions from any address. Once permissions are set, even if there is a problem with that address (such as the private key being stolen, etc.), the administrator cannot revoke it. This is a lack of functionality. The loss of both permissions of the protocol is fatal to the protocol, so I judge the harm to be high.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the status parameter correctly. The following is a pseudocode that may not compile, but it fully explains how to modify it:

```diff
-      _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
+      _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (status << role));
```
