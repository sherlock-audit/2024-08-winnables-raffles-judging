# Admin can't revoke role.

## Summary
`Roles._setRole()` function can set role for user but can't revoke role form user.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Roles._setRole()` function is following.
```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function doesn't use `status` parameter at all.
That is, even though `status = false`, it sets role for user instead of revoking role from user.

## Impact
Admin can't revoke role from users.
If user addresses are compromised, admin has to revoke role from users.
However, current implementation can't revoke role from users,

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `Roles._setRole()` function as follows.
```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
--      _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
++      if (status) _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)) else _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
