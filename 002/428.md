# Incorrect Role Setting in `Roles.sol::_setRole` Allows Only Adding Roles, Not Removing

### Summary

The `_setRole` function in the `Roles.sol` contract incorrectly sets roles due to the misuse of bitwise operations. This causes roles to always be added, regardless of the status parameter, and never removed.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability is located in the _setRole function:

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
The issue arises from the use of the bitwise OR operation (|) without considering the status parameter. This operation always sets the bit corresponding to the role, regardless of whether the intention is to add or remove the role.
Additionally, there's no mechanism to remove a role once it's been set. The status parameter in both _setRole and setRole functions is effectively ignored in the role assignment logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

Example:

Adding a role works as expected:

```solidity
Existing roles: 0000
1 << 2:         0100
Result of OR:   0100
```
Removing a role fails:

```solidity
Existing roles: 0100
1 << 2:         0100
Result of OR:   0100

The role remains set, which is incorrect.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- The current role management system has a critical flaw: roles can only be added, not removed.
- If the owner gains a special role that allows them to drain funds, this role cannot be revoked.
- Even if a security review or governance change determines that the owner should no longer have this power, the role remains active.
- This creates a significant risk, as the owner would permanently retain the ability to withdraw funds, even when it's no longer appropriate.

### Impact

- Roles cannot be revoked once assigned, leading to a potential violation of the principle of least privilege.
- This could result in unauthorized access to critical functions if a user's roles should have been revoked but weren't.
- The contract's access control mechanism is fundamentally broken, as it doesn't allow for proper role management.
- The emitted RoleUpdated event may provide false information, as it includes a status that doesn't reflect the actual change made to the role.

### Mitigation

Modify the _setRole function to properly handle both role assignment and removal:

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (status) {
        roles |= (1 << role);  // Set the role
    } else {
        roles &= ~(1 << role);  // Clear the role
    }
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles);
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
