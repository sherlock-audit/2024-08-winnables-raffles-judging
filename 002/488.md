# WinnablesTicket::transferOwnership does not update roles correctly

### Summary

The [transferOwnership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L173-L176) does not update the roles correctly, leaving the old owner with the admin rights on roles. He can still add new minters to the role 1. The new admin does not get any admin rights on the Roles.sol contract and therefore has no way to modify those roles.

### Root Cause

The [transferOwnership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L173-L176) only updates the local owner and does not update the roles. To update those, the function also has to call [_setRole](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L33).
