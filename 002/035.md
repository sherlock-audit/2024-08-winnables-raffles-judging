# Roles contract does not implement role invoking

## Summary

`Roles.sol` contract does not implement role invoking.

## Vulnerability Detail

Roles that exist on the `Roles.sol` contract can only be assigned - not revoked. This is probably a design oversight since the `_setRole(address, uint8, bool)` takes the `status` boolean argument which is suppose to determine whether or not to grant or revoke the role.

## Impact

Outdated credentials can become a security vulnerability if not properly decommissioned. Centralization issues when sunsetting or changing admins.
Also - do not underestimate the possibility of accidental role approval to unwanted addresses. That enough should warrant a mechanism for revoking roles.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement role revoking on `Roles.sol` contract - maybe as such:
```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));

    if (status == false) {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(0);
    }
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
