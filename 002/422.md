# Granted role can never be revoked.

### Summary

The function that is used to set the role is also intended to be used for revoking the role as it takes the status boolean but when doing bit manipulation (like my ex manipulated me), dev forgot to incorporate the status into it. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of this bug lies in the bitwise operation used to set roles:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L37

```solidity
_addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
```

This operation only ever adds roles (sets bits to 1) and never removes them. The status parameter, which presumably should determine whether to add or remove a role, is not used in the actual role assignment logic.





### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin grants a role to BOB.
2. Now admin wants to revoke the role from BOB, but he can't because revoking logic is missing, even after admin input status to false, it will again set it to 1 (true)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Once a role is granted, it can never be removed. 

### PoC

Add following foundry test to confirm this behaviour

```solidity
    function testRoleCannotBeRevoked() public {
        // Grant role 1
        roleManager.setRole(user, 1, true);
        assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(user, 1), "Role 1 should be granted");

        // Attempt to revoke role 1
        roleManager.setRole(user, 1, false);
        assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(user, 1), "Role 1 should still be granted even after attempted revocation");

        // Grant role 2
        roleManager.setRole(user, 2, true);
        assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(user, 2), "Role 2 should be granted");

        // Attempt to revoke both roles
        roleManager.setRole(user, 1, false);
        roleManager.setRole(user, 2, false);
        assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(user, 1), "Role 1 should still be granted after second revocation attempt");
        assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(user, 2), "Role 2 should still be granted after revocation attempt");
    }
    
```

### Mitigation

Use the following code:

Note: This implementation needs to be looked and evaluated, don't trust it blindly

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    require(role < 256, "Invalid role");
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    
    if (status) {
        roles |= (1 << role);  // Set the role
    } else {
        roles &= ~(1 << role);  // Clear the role
    }
    
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles);
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}

```
