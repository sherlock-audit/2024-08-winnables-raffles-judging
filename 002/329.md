# Granted roles with Roles.sol:_setRole cannot be revoked and leads addresses to permanently hold given role

## Summary
Granted roles cannot be revoked, cause status flag is not used in Roles.sol:_setRole and leads addresses to permanently hold given role because there is no way to revoke assigned role

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies on Roles.sol:_setRole function (called from external Roles.sol:setRole function) cause it always set role bit to true ignoring status boolean value, so there is no way to revoke role
```solidity
    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status); //<- status value is passed to internal function
    }

    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // <- status value is ignored
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
This is the only available function to modify roles on project, so there isnt a way to revoke a role to an address

Sample scenario
1. Admin gives admin role to user U address
2. Later user U address is compromised
3. Now, compromised U address is not trusted but still has project's admin privileges
4. Admin tries to revoke compromised U address privilege role but there is no way to do it

## Impact
A granted role cannot be revoked, so, making it a one way action, also setting protocol at risk if only one address is compromised

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify Roles.sol:_setRole code to be able to revoke a role using the status boolean value.
The proposed modification grants role if status param is set to true, and revokes role if value is false
```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        if(status){
            _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        }else{
            _addressRoles[user]  = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
        }
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
