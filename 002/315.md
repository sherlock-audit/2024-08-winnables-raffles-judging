# Roles can be invoked, but not revoked

## Summary

In the current implementation of `Roles::setRole` there are three parameters that the function accepts: user, role and status. The problem is that the third parameter, status, it's not used at all(only in the event emission). After a conversation with the protocol team, they confirmed that this parameter should be used for adding or removing a role.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a role needs to be revoked due to security concerns, such as a leaked private key or compromised account, the current implementation fails to address this need. This oversight could potentially lead to prolonged unauthorized access, increasing the risk of misuse or exploitation.

## Impact

Admin can't revoke a already granted role to a user or contract. If a private key has leaked for example and clearly we wanted to have this ability but the function is implemented wrong

## Code Snippet

```solidity
   function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }

    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
   function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
+      if (status) {
            _addressRoles[user] = currentRoles | bytes32(1 << role);
+        } else {
+           _addressRoles[user] = currentRoles & ~bytes32(1 << role);
+       }
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }

    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status);
    }
```
