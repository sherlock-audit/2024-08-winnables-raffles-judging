# The status paramenter is not used when assigning roles, so roles cannot be revoked after it has been given.

### Summary

When setting roles the admin calls the `setRole` function, passing three parameters, the user address, the role, and the status, the problem here is that status is not used in setting the role, it is only emitted, so roles cannot be revoked after they have been granted.

### Root Cause

In [`Roles.sol:551`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29) the status parameter is not used anywhere within the function to assign the role, so when a role is granted it cannot be revoked.

```sol
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

This issue doesn't need any precondition, it is always an issue along as the protocol is deployed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Roles cannot be revoked so if an account gets compromised it will always have a role within the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

if the status is false revoke the address role.

```diff
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
+      if (!status) {
+            _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(0);
+       }
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
