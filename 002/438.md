# Admin can't remove address from roles due to broken setRole()

## Summary
Admin can't remove address from roles due to broken setRole()

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin has the authority to assign roles to other user through setRole(), but the issue is once a address is set for a role, admin  can't  remove using setRole() due to broken _setRole()
```solidity
 function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }

    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status);
    }
```
This will harm all 3 main contracts ie Ticket.sol, TicketManager.sol, PrizeManager.sol because all these contracts are using Roles.sol to assign role1 to different users/contracts
```solidity
contract WinnablesPrizeManager is Roles, BaseCCIPSender, BaseCCIPReceiver, IWinnablesPrizeManager {
```
```solidity
contract WinnablesTicket is Roles, IWinnablesTicket {
```
```solidity
contract WinnablesTicketManager is Roles, VRFConsumerBaseV2, IWinnablesTicketManager, BaseCCIPSender, BaseCCIPReceiver
```

## Impact
Users can't be removed from their roles once assigned

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
Rewrite the _setRole(), so that it resets the users role
