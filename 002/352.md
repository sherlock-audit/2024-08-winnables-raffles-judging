# Admin can't remove any roles once they were set

### Summary

Incorrect implementation of ````Roles._setRole()```` will cause any roles unable to be cancelled once they were set.


### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L31
In ````Roles.sol:31````, the ````status```` variable is ignored while calculating new roles for ````_addressRoles[user]````, and the related role bit will always be set to true.
```solidity
File: contracts\Roles.sol
29:     function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
30:         uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
31:         _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // @audit always set to true
32:         emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
33:     }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

Admins set any roles for some addresses

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Admin calls ````Roles.setRole()```` with ````status=false```` to remove some role.

### Impact

Any roles can't be cancelled
