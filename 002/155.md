# Role Assignment and Revocation Issues in `Roles.sol`

## Summary
There is no provision to unset a role, and the status parameter in the setRole function is not effectively utilized. These issues could lead to potential misuse or misconfiguration of roles within the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
No Provision to Unset a Role: The _setRole function allows setting roles for a user but lacks the functionality to unset or revoke a role. This could lead to a scenario where roles, once granted, cannot be revoked, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.
Misuse of the status Parameter: The setRole function includes a status parameter that is intended to control the role assignment. However, the current implementation of the _setRole function does not utilize the status parameter effectively, raising concerns about the role admin's ability to set the correct status. The role management logic lacks clarity on the purpose and implementation of the status parameter, which could lead to unintended role assignments.

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

## Impact
The identified vulnerabilities could lead to significant security risks:

Privilege Escalation: The inability to revoke roles may allow users to retain privileges they should no longer have, leading to unauthorized actions within the system.
Misconfiguration: The unclear usage of the status parameter may result in incorrect role assignments, compromising the integrity and security of the system.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L37

```solidity
// @audit-info there is no provision to unset a role!

// _addressRoles[user] &= ~bytes32(1 << 1);

function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}

// @audit-info Are you we trusting the roles admin to set the correct status?
// what is the use of the status parameter?
function setRole(
    address user,
    uint8 role,
    bool status
)
    external
    virtual
    onlyRole(0)
{
    _setRole(user, role, status);
}

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the identified vulnerabilities:

Implement Role Unset Functionality: Introduce a mechanism to unset or revoke roles by adding a bitwise operation that allows clearing a specific role from a user. This will ensure that roles can be both granted and revoked as needed.

Example Implementation:
```solidity
function _unsetRole(address user, uint8 role) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, false);
}
```
Clarify and Implement the `status` Parameter: Ensure that the `status` parameter in the `setRole` function is used to determine whether a role should be set or unset. Update the `_setRole` function to respect the `status` parameter, granting the role when `status` is true and revoking it when false.
