# M-04 Lack of Role Revocation Functionality in `_setRole` May Lead to Unintended Privileges

### Summary

In the `Roles` contract, the internal function `_setRole` is used to assign roles to users, but it does not correctly handle role revocation, even though the `status` parameter is present in the function. This issue arises because the function always adds roles using a bitwise OR operation, regardless of the value of `status`. As a result, roles can only be assigned, not removed. This could lead to scenarios where users retain privileges even after attempting to revoke them.

### Root Cause

In the `Roles` contract, the `_setRole` function on line 29 uses a bitwise OR operation on line 31 to assign roles without considering the `status` parameter. This design choice effectively ignores the `status` flag meant to control whether a role should be assigned or revoked. Specifically, the bitwise OR operation `roles | (1 << role)` adds the role bit to the userâ€™s existing roles, but never removes it, making it impossible to revoke roles through this function.

Vulnerable line:
```solidity
  _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The role to be assigned or revoked must be passed as the `role` parameter.
2. The `status` parameter is provided but not utilized in a way that affects role removal.

### External pre-conditions

1. The `setRole` function is called by a user with `role(0)` (Admin role).
2. The admin tries to revoke a role by setting `status` to `false`.

### Attack Path

1. The admin calls `setRole` with a `role` and sets `status` to `false` intending to revoke the role.
2. The `_setRole` function ignores the `status` parameter and only adds the `role` using a bitwise OR operation.
3. The role remains assigned/unchanged, and the user retains privileges unintentionally.

### Impact

The lack of role revocation can have significant security implications. Administrators cannot effectively manage user roles, leading to users retaining unauthorized privileges. This can cause major operational risks, such as unauthorized access to critical functions, which could compromise the security and integrity of the system.

### PoC

1. **Initial Setup:**
      * Admin Role (bit 0): `0001`
      * User Role (bit 1): `0010`
      * Assume we have a user who currently only has the Admin role, so their roles are represented by `0001`.

2. **Assigning the User Role:**
     * Current Role Bits: `0001` (Admin)
     * Operation: Perform a bitwise OR with `0010` (User role)
     * Bitwise OR Operation: `0001 | 0010 = 0011`
     * Result: The user now has both Admin and User roles `(0011)`
```solidity
uint256 roles = 1; // 0001 (Admin role)
roles = roles | (1 << 1); // Bitwise OR with User role (0010)
// Result: roles = 0011 (Admin + User roles)
```

3. **Reapplying the OR Operation with the User Role:**
     * Current Role Bits: `0011` (Admin + User).
     * Operation: Perform the bitwise OR again with `0010` (User role).
     * Bitwise OR Operation: `0011 | 0010 = 0011`
     * Result: The roles remain unchanged as `0011`. The bitwise OR operation does not toggle bits; it only ensures they are set to 1.
```solidity
roles = roles | (1 << 1); // Reapplying Bitwise OR with User role (0010)
// Result: roles = 0011 (still Admin + User roles)
```

### Mitigation

The `_setRole` function should be updated to handle both role assignment and revocation based on the `status` parameter. This can be done by using a conditional check:
```solidity
if (status) {
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // Assign role
} else {
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role)); // Revoke role
}
```
This modification ensures that roles are assigned or revoked correctly based on the `status` parameter, improving the security and flexibility of role management within the contract.
