# The attacker can prevent the winner and the administrator from withdrawing funds from the prize pool.

## Summary
In the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, the `cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner` functions can specify any `prizeManager ` address and `chainSelector`, and both functions can be called by anyone. This allows a malicious actor to send a CCIP message to the wrong contract, preventing the state in the WinnablesPrizeManager contract from being updated(but `WinnablesTicketManager` contract`s state has update), which can block the winner from receiving the reward.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the first scenario, when a raffle round does not collect enough tickets, the raffle needs to be canceled:
1. A malicious actor can call the `cancelRaffle` function, passing in an incorrect `prizeManager` address or an incorrect `chainSelector`. The CCIP is sent, and the status of the raffle in the `WinnablesTicketManager` changes to CANCELED, preventing the `cancelRaffle` function from being called again. The participants can then retrieve their funds normally.
2. However, due to the incorrect target address or target chain, the CCIP message will not be routed to the correct `WinnablesPrizeManager`, preventing the administrator from releasing the locked prize pool funds.  

In the second scenario, when the winner has already been selected:
1. A malicious actor can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` function, passing in an incorrect `prizeManager` address or an incorrect `chainSelector`. The CCIP message is sent, and the status of the raffle in the `WinnablesTicketManager` changes to PROPAGATED, allowing the administrator to withdraw the funds from the ticks normally.
2. However, due to the incorrect target address or target chain, the CCIP message will not be routed to the correct `WinnablesPrizeManager`, preventing the winner from being updated and the winner from receiving the prize pool funds.
## Impact
The raffle status in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract will not be updated, but the status in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract will have already been updated. As a result, it becomes impossible to resend the correct CCIP message to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract through normal means, preventing the winner from receiving the reward or the administrator from withdraw the prize pool funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set prizeManager and chainSelector as immutable variables. If they are adjustable by the administrator, it could increase the risk of the administrator preventing the winner from receiving the prize funds.
```solidity
+        address immutable internal prizeManager;
+        uint64 immutable internal chainSelector;
          constructor(
              address _linkToken,
              address _vrfCoordinator,
              uint64 _subscriptionId,
              bytes32 _keyHash,
              address _tickets,
              address _ccipRouter,
+            address _prizeManager
+            uint64 _chainSelector;
          ) VRFConsumerBaseV2(_vrfCoordinator) BaseCCIPContract(_ccipRouter) BaseLinkConsumer(_linkToken) {
              VRF_COORDINATOR = _vrfCoordinator;
              SUBSCRIPTION_ID = _subscriptionId;
              KEY_HASH = _keyHash;
              TICKETS_CONTRACT = _tickets;
              _setRole(msg.sender, 0, true); // Deployer is admin by default
              LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, type(uint256).max);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(

        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
