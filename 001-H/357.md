# Malicious user can cancel raffle with incorrect chain selector to Make the prize be stuck

### Summary

Malicious user can cancel raffle with incorrect chain selector to Make the prize be stuck

### Root Cause

in WinnablesTicketManager.sol ln 278
https://github.com/Winnables/public-contracts/blob/267dd06e2d5636f30e3311c46ed24b76ac6614c5/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278

any user can cancel a raffle if it is eligible to be canceled. When calling the function `cancelRaffle`, the function sets the raffles status to canceled and then the function sends a ccip message to the chosen chain, this message will then call the ccip receive on the chosen chain and cancel the raffle and then unlocking the prize. this can be observed below 
```solidity
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```
The problem is that the user is free to pick the chainSelector, this is a problem because the user can input the incorrect chain and the message will be sent to a chain where there is no contract. This will cause the raffle to not be able to be canceled on the correct destination chain and therefore the prize will never be unlocked. This means any malicious user can essentially lock the prize in the contract forever.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. the raffle should be eligible to be canceled

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. the raffle did not reach enough ticket sales
2. malicious user calls `cancelRaffle` on the WinnablesTicketManager contract with the incorrect chainSelector
3. the users will be able to refund their ticket proceeds
4. the winnablesPrizeManager contract on the correct chain will never receive the ccip message and the prize will remain locked

### Impact

Malicious user can easily lock the prize from the raffle forever 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

do not allow users to select the chainSelector when calling `cancelRaffle`
