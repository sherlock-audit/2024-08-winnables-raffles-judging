# Malicious user can call propagateRaffleWinner() with different `prizeManager` to prevent winner form claiming his rewards

## Summary
Malicious user can call `propagateRaffleWinner()` with different `prizeManager` to prevent winner form claiming his rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
A winner can claim his rewards in prizeManager.sol after calling `propagateRaffleWinner()`. It takes `prizeManager`, `chainSelector`, `raffleId` and sends a CCIP message to prizeManager.sol to set winner in `_rafflePrize[raffleId].winner`
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
...
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner)
        );
...
    }
```
```solidity
    function _ccipReceive(Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message) internal override {
...
        (raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
@>      _rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
        emit WinnerPropagated(raffleId, winner);
    }
```
Now the problem is, propagateRaffleWinner() doesn't verify that `prizeManagerAddress` & `chainSelector` are real/original or not.

A malicious user can deploy a `fake` prizeManager.sol with `CCIPReceiver` and use its address in propagateRaffleWinner(). As result, status of the raffle will be `PROPAGATED` & CCIP message will be sent to fake prizeManager.sol.

Also winner can't call propagateRaffleWinner() again because there is status check which will revert

## Impact
Winner will not be able to claim his rewards(ETH/NFT/Token) in real prizeManager.sol because it doesn't set the winner in `_rafflePrize[raffleId].winner` as CCIP message was sent to fake prizeManager.sol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Verify prizeManager & chainSelector before passing to _sendCCIPMessage()
```diff
   function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);
+       bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(prizeManager, chainSelector);
+       if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
