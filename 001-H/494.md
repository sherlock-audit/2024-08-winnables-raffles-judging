# A malicious user can permanently lock the prizes, exposing the protocol to loss

### Summary

The lack of validation for the target chain and recipient of the CCIP message in the `cancelRaffle` function can lead to rewards being permanently locked in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. The contract owner has no way to transfer the locked rewards, which puts the protocol at risk of financial loss.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L278), there is no validation to ensure that the caller of the `cancelRaffle` function has provided the correct target chain selector and recipient (Prize Manager). As a result, an attacker can send messages to any other contract instead of the intended one.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The admin must lock a reward in the `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` contract.
2. `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` must receive the message and change the reward status to `PRIZE_LOCKED`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the change in reward status on Avalanche by observing the mempool or listening for the `RafflePrizeLocked` event.
2. After the status change, the attacker calls the `cancelRaffle` function with parameters that allow the transaction to proceed but without sending the message to the `PrizeManager`.
3. Once the `cancelRaffle` function is executed, the status of the raffle in the TicketManager will be changed to `CANCELED`, preventing further status changes.
4. The absence of the received message in `WinnablesPrizeManager` means that the `_ccipReceive` and `_cancelRaffle` functions, which unlock the assets locked as rewards, will not be triggered.

### Impact

1. The protocol incurs a loss due to CCIP transmission fees in the `WinnablesTicketManager`.
2. The reward in `WinnablesPrizeManager` becomes permanently locked because only a received message can unlock the reward (the admin can only withdraw unlocked assets via the `withdrawToken`, `withdrawNFT`, and `withdrawETH` functions).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. If the `cancelRaffle` function is intended to be available to everyone, the data provided by the user should be validated, allowing only the appropriate `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`.
2. A good solution could be to set these parameters (since they are immutable for the chain) beforehand, so they don't need to be provided as function arguments.

The final solution should align with the application's design decisions.
