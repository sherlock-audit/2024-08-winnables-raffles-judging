# propagateRaffleWinner() doesn't verify prizeManager & chainSelector before sending ccip message

## Summary
propagateRaffleWinner() doesn't verify `prizeManager` & `chainSelector` before sending ccip message

## Vulnerability Detail
When winner of a raffle is decided/selected then anyone can call propagateRaffleWinner(), which sends a message to prizeManager contract to allow winner to claim his reward

propagateRaffleWinner() doesn't verify the prizeManager & chainSelector before sending ccip message. A malicious using can create fake prizeManger, which can receive ccip call. Now use that address in propagateRaffleWinner(), which will make the call to fake prizeManager. 
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
```solidity
function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();

        CCIPMessageType messageType = CCIPMessageType(uint8(message.data[0]));
        uint256 raffleId;
        address winner;
        if (messageType == CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED) {
            raffleId = _decodeRaffleCanceledMessage(message.data);
            _cancelRaffle(raffleId);
            return;
        }
-->     (raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
        _rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
        emit WinnerPropagated(raffleId, winner);
    }
```

## Impact
Winner will not be able to claim his rewards because call was not make to real prizemanager.sol

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
Verify both prizemanager & chainSelector before making ccip call
