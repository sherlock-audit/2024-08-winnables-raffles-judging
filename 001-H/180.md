# `propagateRaffleWinner` function lacks validation

## Summary
Anyone can call `propagateRaffleWinner` with any destination chain or any address parameters, an attacker can call it with wrong parameters to permanently lock prizes and the admin can still withdraw the funds made from ticket sales.
## Vulnerability Detail
After a request for randomness is fulfilled, `propagateRaffleWinner` should be called to notify `WinnablesPrizeManager ` of the outcome. However anyone can call `propagateRaffleWinner` with any destination chain or any address parameters.
This will set the raffle status to PROPAGATED on `WinnablesTicketManager`  but state of the raffle will not be updated on `WinnablesPrizeManager `. At this point because `_lockedETH` is decreased, admin can withdraw the ETH from the contract as if the raffle happened and due to the message being sent to another address/chain than `WinnablesPrizeManager `, prize will be stuck.
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED; //@audit status is now PROPAGATED, can't call this function again
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised; //@audit _lockedETH decreased, now admin can withdraw ETH made from sales
        }
    }
```
Users will not be able to call `refundPlayers` as the status of raffle is PROPAGATED.
```solidity
    function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        //--omitted--
    }
```
Admin can withdraw user funds as _lockedETH has been decreased.
```solidity
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```
## Impact
Prize will be stuck indefinitely, user funds can be stolen by admin and can not be refunded.
