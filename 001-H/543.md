# WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner can be called by anyone with an invalid prizeManager address

### Summary

When raffle is fulfilled and a winner is picked, anyone can call [WinnablesTicketManager.sol::propagateRaffleWinner(..)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334-L345). The caller sets the address of the receiving `prizeManager` and the `chainSelector`. The input values are not validated. So a caller can call with any parameter that is not the zero address or the value zero. After the status of the raffle is updated to `PROPAGATED`, it sends the ccip msg. This call will not revert, as any address is a valid target for a ccip call [see](https://docs.chain.link/ccip).

The raffle is stuck at `RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED`. Therefore the WinnablesTicketManager.sol thinks the raffle is finished, but the WinnablesPrizeManager.sol never got the msg who won that raffleId. In that contracts view no winner was ever picked. The prices will be locked forever.

Notice: While this report mostly talks about a invalid prizeManager, a invalid chainSelector can also cause the same issue.

This is a serious DOS attack with indefinite lockup times.

### Root Cause

[propagateRaffleWinner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334-L345) does not check if the CCIP msg receiver is a valid CCIP counterpart. It should only allow msg to that receiver. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Raffle must be in state `RaffleStatus.FULFILLED` (normal state for each raffle)
2. Attacker is able to front run honest users/the protocol as propagateRaffleWinner can only be called once per raffle

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. call propagateRaffleWinner with an incorrect `prizeManager` or `chainSelector`

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

Adding this test to the existing [TicketManager.js](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/TicketManager.js) shows how an attacker is able to set a invalid receiver:

     it('Should be able to propagate when the winner is drawn', async () => {

   As this test does not revert, it is shown that it is possible to send to a random CCIP receiver blocking that raffle id indefinitely.

### Mitigation

[BaseCCIPSender::_sendCCIPMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPSender.sol#L15-L50) should validate if the intended receiver is a valid CCIP contact.  For example with this change:
