# An attacker will permanently lock prizes in `WinnablesPrizeManager` by calling `cancelRaffle` with an arbitrary prizeManager address

### Summary

Lack of access control in the `cancelRaffle` function will cause permanent locking of NFTs, ETH, and Tokens in the  `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract as an attacker will call the function with an arbitrary prizeManager address, causing the raffle to be marked as canceled without properly sending the CCIP message.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278), the `cancelRaffle` function lacks access control, allowing anyone to call it with arbitrary parameters, leading to the raffle being marked as canceled without verifying the prizeManager address and chainSelector.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls `cancelRaffle` with an arbitrary prizeManager address and a valid raffleId.
2. The function sets the raffle status to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED`, preventing the function from being called again for the same raffle.
3. The function attempts to send a CCIP message to the arbitrary prizeManager address. However, if the address is incorrect, the intended `WinnablesPrizeManager` never receives the message.
4. Since the `WinnablesPrizeManager` never receives the `RAFFLE_CANCELED` message, the `_cancelRaffle` function in `WinnablesPrizeManager` is never executed.
5. As a result, NFTs, ETH, and Tokens that were locked for the raffle remain locked forever, as there is no subsequent way to unlock them.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from permanent locking of NFTs, ETH, or Tokens associated with the canceled raffle. These assets remain frozen, and neither the attacker nor any admins could withdraw or unlock them. The prizes are effectively frozen within the contract indefinitely.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement access control on the `cancelRaffle` function to ensure that only authorized roles can call it. Alternatively, validate the `prizeManager` address and `chainSelector` parameters.
