# Attacker can block the winner from claiming the prize

### Summary

After a raffle concludes and a winner is selected, any user can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` function to send the winner's details to the prize manager, enabling the winner to claim the prize using the `claimPrize` function. However, an issue arises because the `propagateRaffleWinner` function does not validate the user-provided data. This allows an attacker to send a CCIP message to any contract, changing the raffle's status to `PROPAGATED`. If the winner's information does not reach the prize manager, they will be unable to claim the prize, and the altered raffle status will prevent the `propagateRaffleWinner` function from being called again.

### Root Cause

The lack of validation for parameters passed to the [propagateRaffleWinner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334-L334) function (`prizeManager`, `chainSelector`).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The raffle winner is selected.
2. The raffle has a `FULFILLED` status (the VRF returns a random number).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the status change of the raffle on Avalanche, either by observing the mempool or listening for the `WinnerDrawn` event.
2. Upon status change, the attacker calls the `propagateRaffleWinner` function with parameters that allow the transaction to succeed but without sending the message to the `PrizeManager`.

### Impact

1. The protocol incurs a loss due to CCIP transmission fees in `WinnablesTicketManager` caused by the attacker.
2. Since the winner's information never reaches the prize manager, they will be unable to claim their prize using the [`claimPrize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L105) function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the `propagateRaffleWinner` function is intended to be available to everyone, the data provided by the user should be validated, allowing only the appropriate `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`.

A good solution could be to set these parameters (since they are immutable for the chain) beforehand so that they don't need to be provided as function arguments.

The final solution should align with the application's design decisions.
