# Anyone can call cancelRaffle on WinnablesTicketManager with arbitrary function arguments

## Summary

Function `cancelRaffle` accepts user provided arguments for `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` AND it does not have any access control mechanism as well. This means the function can call arbitrary cross-chain contract and end up with updated state without the `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` knowing anything about the state change.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract does not check if the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` are real/system contracts on the other chain. This means an attacker call his own contracts on other chain that do nothing - however `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract ends up with updated state.

`_raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;`

## Impact

Raffle is canceled but prizes are not unlocked on `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` contract.

This is under the assumption the raffle is in `PRIZE_LOCKED` state.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use stored cross-chain counterpart contracts for cross-chain messages - not user provided ones.
