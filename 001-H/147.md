# A malicious user can lock the prize for winning a raffle provided by the admin when a raffle is canceled

### Summary

An admin of the Winnables protocol can create a raffle by first calling the [lockNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L148-L165), [lockETH()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L172-L188), or the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) functions in order to lock the prize that the winner of the raffle will receive. Then a CCIP message will be sent to the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract, and set the **RaffleStatus** for the raffle id to **PRIZE_LOCKED**. Then the admin has to call the [createRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L252C5-L274) function in order to fully set the raffle, and users can start buying tickets. If the raffle has ended and the bought tickets are below the **minTicketsThreshold** set by the admin, the raffle can be canceled by everyone. However the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function takes an arbitrary **prizeManager** and **chainSelector** as arguments:
```solidity
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function also sets the **_raffles[raffleId].status** to **RaffleStatus.CANCELED**. As can be seen from the [_checkShouldCancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L434-L441) function, if the raffleStatus is **CANCALED**, the function will revert. 
```solidity
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```
A malicious user can call the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function in order to cancel a raffle, and supply a **prizeManager** address that is different than the address of the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` deployed contract where the admin initially locked the reward for the winner of the raffle. A malicious actor can simply deploy another contract that can receive CCIP messages (so the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function doesn't revert). The  [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function can't be called again for the same raffle ID, and the funds that the admin initially locked in the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract will be locked forever, resulting in a loss of funds for the admin. 

### Root Cause

The [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function can be called by anyone, with arbitrary **prizeManager** and **chainSelector** arguments.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Raffle with ID 1 has expired and the bought tickets are below the **minTicketsThreshold** set by the admin, now the raffle can be canceled.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Raffle with ID 1 has expired and the bought tickets are below the **minTicketsThreshold** set by the admin, now the raffle can be canceled.
2. A malicious user deploys a contract which can receive CCIP messages, lets call it **ContractB**
3. The malicious user calls the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function but instead of providing the correct address of the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract, where the admin initially locked funds, he provides the address of **ContractB**. 

### Impact

The funds that the admin locked as a reward for the winner of the raffle, either an NFT, ETH, or some ERC20 token will be locked forever in the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider setting up the **prizeManager** and **chainSelector** in the constructor, or create a function that can be called only once  by the admin with the correct parameters.  Use those parameters in the [cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278-L288) function, don't allow users to provide arbitrary parameters.
