# An attacker can propagate the winner to a wrong chain to lock the prize.

## Summary
In `TicketManager` contract anyone can call `propagateRaffleWinner` function to propagate winner to the ETH chain by sending a CCIP message. But as the user can select the `chainSelector`, an attacker can send the message to the wrong chain to lock the prize on the ETH Mainnet forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
When propagating winner an attacker can propagate the message to the wrong which will change the status of Raffle to PROPAGATED and so the winner cannot be propagated to correct chain(ETH) anymore and prize in the ETH chain will be locked forever.

```solidity
    // @audit-issue An attacker can propagate the winner to a wrong chain to lock the prize.
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
The same issue also exists in `cancelRaffle` function where the attacker can send cancelRaffle message to wrong chain to make the prize stuck in the prizeManager contract on ETH chain forever.

```solidity
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

**PoC**
1. Admin locks 10 ETH in prizeManager contract in ETH chain and creates Raffle on Avalanche with that locked prize.
2. After Raffle ends the send propagate winner message to Polygon chain instead of sending it to ETH.
3. Raffle status is changed to PROPAGATED after attacker sends that message to Polygon.
4. Now winner cannot be propagated to ETH chain anymore and that 10 ETH will be locked forever on ETH chain.

## Impact
Prize in the ETH chain will be locked forever.

## Recommendation
When sending messages to source chain instead of letting the user select `chainSelector` save and fetch it from Raffle. And only allow messages to that chain where prize for that Raffle is locked
