# `getWinner` Function Fails When Chainlink VRF Subscription Is Expired

## Summary
The `getWinner` function may fail or return  incorrect results if the Chainlink VRF subscription used for the raffle has expired. This occurs because the function doesn't verify that the VRF request has been fulfilled, leading to errors when the subscription is inactive.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getWinner` function relies on a successful Chainlink VRF request to determine the raffle winner. If the VRF subscription expires before the request is fulfilled, the function will fail to retrieve a valid random number. This can lead to either a function revert or the incorrect determination of a winner.
## Impact
Users cannot obtain the winner of a raffle if the VRF subscription is expired, leading to failed transactions or unfulfilled raffles.

## Recommendation
Add explicit error messages or conditions to handle scenarios where the VRF data is not available due to subscription issues. As shown below

```solidity
function getWinner(uint256 raffleId) external view returns (address winner) {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED || raffle.status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED) {
        revert RaffleNotFulfilled();
    }
    
    // Check if the request ID has been fulfilled and is valid
    bytes32 requestId = raffle.chainlinkRequestId;
    if (requestId == bytes32(0) || !_isRequestFulfilled(requestId)) {
        revert RequestNotFulfilled();
    }
    
    winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(requestId);
    
    // Optional: Validate the winner address (e.g., ensure it's not a zero address)
    if (winner == address(0)) {
        revert InvalidWinner();
    }
    
    return winner;
}
```
```solidity
// Example helper function to check if the request ID has been fulfilled
function _isRequestFulfilled(bytes32 requestId) private view returns (bool) {
    // Implement logic to check if the request ID has been fulfilled
    return _fulfilledRequests[requestId];
}
```
