# Admin cannot withdraw leftover assets in winnerableTicketManager contract

### Summary

when users call `WinnerablesTicketManager::buyTickets` they send ETH to `WinnerablesTicketManager` and [_lockETH will be increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L206) but in some senarios _lockETH wouldn't decrease and this cause insolvency

### Root Cause

Raffles can be cancelled if they don't reach threshold and [every user can cancel them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) and after that [`WinnerableTicketManager::refundPlayers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215) can be called by anyone to refund players asset but when that call _lockETH wouldn't update and this cause _lockETH has a wrong value



### Impact

admin calls [`WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L303) to get locked ETHs in this contract,Admin get payout for tickets with this function ,but if _lockedETH has a wrong value causes ETHs locks in `WinnablesTicketManager`

### PoC

Textual PoC:
- The admin creates a raffle.
- A user (Alice) purchases a ticket, sending 1 ETH to the WinnerablesTicketManager contract. The contract's balance is now 1 ETH, and _lockETH is also 1 ETH.
- A user cancels the raffle by invoking the WinnerableTicketManager::cancelRaffle function.
- Alice calls WinnerableTicketManager::refundPlayers, which refunds the 1 ETH to her. The contract's balance is now 0 ETH, but _lockETH remains incorrectly set at 1 ETH.
- The admin creates a new raffle.
- Other users buy tickets, and the contract accumulates 1 ETH from these purchases. The contract's balance is now 1 ETH, but _lockETH incorrectly shows 2 ETH.
- When the admin attempts to withdraw ETH by calling WinnerableTicketManager::withdrawETH, the function fails due to the incorrect _lockETH value, causing an error.


### Mitigation
_lockETH should update in `WinnerbaleTicketManager::refundPlayers`
