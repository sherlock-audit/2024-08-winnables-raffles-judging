# Potential for Locked ETH in the `WinnablesTicketManager`

The `_lockedETH` state variable, which tracks the total amount of ETH locked in active raffles, is not consistently updated across all relevant functions (`cancelRaffle` and `refundPlayers`). This could lead to a discrepancy between the actual locked ETH and the tracked amount, potentially causing issues with fund management and withdrawals.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the inconsistent updating of the `_lockedETH` variable. While it's incremented in the `buyTickets` function and decremented in the `propagateRaffleWinner` function, it's not updated in the `cancelRaffle` or `refundPlayers` functions. This oversight can lead to the _lockedETH variable becoming out of sync with the actual locked funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

Raffle needs to be created and now is canceled

### External pre-conditions

None specific; this is an internal state management issue.


### Attack Path

This is not an attack per se, but a system flaw that could be exploited:

1.Multiple raffles are created and tickets are sold, increasing _lockedETH.
2. Some raffles are completed, and propagateRaffleWinner is called, correctly decreasing _lockedETH.
3. Other raffles are canceled, but cancelRaffle doesn't update _lockedETH.
4. refundPlayers is called for canceled raffles, refunding ETH to players without updating _lockedETH.
5. Over time, the _lockedETH variable becomes significantly higher than the actual amount of ETH that should be locked.
This discrepancy could prevent legitimate withdrawals or allow excessive withdrawals, depending on how _lockedETH is used in withdrawal functions.

### Impact

Lock of funds:the contract has a withdrawal function that uses _lockedETH as a reference,  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300
this will prevent the owner Eth thinking it's still locked

### PoC


1. Create Raffle A.


2. Ticket Purchases:

3. Users purchase tickets for Raffle A, totaling exactly 10 ETH.
4. The buyTickets function is called multiple times, each time increasing the _lockedETH variable.
At this point, _lockedETH should be 10 ETH.

5 Conditions are met to cancel Raffle A (e.g., the raffle end time has passed, but the minimum ticket threshold wasn't reached).
6An authorized user or admin calls the cancelRaffle function for Raffle A.
7.The raffle status is set to CANCELED, but _lockedETH remains unchanged at 10 ETH.
```solidity
function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

Refund Process:

7.The refundPlayers function is called to refund all participants of Raffle A.
8.Each player receives their refund, totaling 10 ETH being sent out of the contract.
Crucially, the refundPlayers function does not update the _lockedETH variable.
```function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```

Final State:

Actual ETH locked in active raffles: 0 ETH (the raffle was cancelled and all funds refunded)
_lockedETH value in the contract: 10 ETH (unchanged from step 3)
Actual balance of the contract: 0 ETH (all funds were refunded)

### Mitigation

Update `_lockedETH `in the `refundPlayers` function:
```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    unchecked {
        _lockedETH -= amountToSend ;
    }
    }```
