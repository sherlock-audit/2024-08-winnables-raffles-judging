# When the function refundPlayers is called, _lockedETH is not decreased/updated.

## Summary

When the function refundPlayers is called, _lockedETH is not decreased/updated. As a result, when the function withdrawETH is called, this will create underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let’s assume, the current raffleId is 1.

2. Currently, _lockedETH = 50e18 eth which is gathered for  raffleId 1 with the function buyTickets.

3.  raffleId 1 is cancelled.

4. 50e18 eth are refunded to  raffleId 1 participants by calling the  function refundPlayers. But the problem is _lockedETH is not decreased after refunding.

5. Now   raffleId 2’s total collected eth = 60e18 and currently _lockedETH = 50e18+60e18 = 110e18(as _lockedETH is not updated for cancelled raffleid 1).

6. Now WinnablesTicketManager’s  address(this).balance = 60e18 and _lockedETH = 110e18.so  balance = 60e18-110e18 = -50e18 which creates underflow.

## Impact

When the function refundPlayers is called, _lockedETH is not decreased/updated. As a result, when the function withdrawETH is called, this will create underflow.
