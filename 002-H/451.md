# lockedETH is not updated while refunding players

## Summary
lockedETH is not updated while refunding players

## Vulnerability Detail
When user buy tickets then it adds to the lockedETH & this lockedETH can't be withdraw by admin.
```solidity
 unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
-->         _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
```
When a raffle got canceled, user can claim their refund through refundPlayers(), but it doesn't update lockedETH amount
```solidity
 function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
refunded amount of ETH will be locked in the contract because when admin withdraws eth, it subtracts the lockedETH

## Recommendation
Subtract the refunded amount from lockedETH
