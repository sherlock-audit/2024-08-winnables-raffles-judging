# lockedETH is not reduced in refundPlayers function

## Summary
In refundPlayers function of WinnableTickerManager contract _lockedETH is not reduced when ETH is refunded to users for cancelled Raffles. Due to this Admin cannot withdraw the ETH collected for passed Raffles

## Vulnerability Detail

In `refundPlayers` function when ETH is refunded to players `_lockedETH` should be reduced by refunded ETH amount. But it is not being reduced in the refundPlayers function. 

**PoC**:

1. Admin created Raffle 1 and Raffle 2.
2. Raffle 1 collected 10 ETH from tickets.
3. _lockedETH is now 10 ETH.
4. Raffle 2 collected 15 ETH from tickets.
5. _lockedETH is now 25 ETH
6. Raffle 1 is cancelled as it didn't reach min ticket threshold.
7. Players of Raffle 1 claimed their 10 ETH refund for Raffle 1.
8. But _ethLocked is still 25 ETH as it isn't reduced in `refundPlayers` function.
9. Now Raffle 2 is completed and winner is propagated so `_ethLocked` is reduced by 15 ETH. 

```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
@>          _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

10. At this point contract has 15 ETH and admin should be able to claim all of it but the admin can only claim 5 ETH because _lockedETH is still 10ETH. 

```solidity
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
@>         balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```


## Impact
ETH will be get stuck in the `TickerManager` contract forever.
