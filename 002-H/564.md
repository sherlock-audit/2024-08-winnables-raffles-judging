# Inconsistent ETH Locking Mechanism Leading to Fund Lockup

# Summary

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract contains a critical vulnerability in its ETH locking mechanism. The `_lockedETH` state variable is not properly updated during refund operations, leading to a cumulative discrepancy between the perceived and actual locked ETH. This inconsistency can be exploited to artificially inflate the `_lockedETH` value, resulting in the inability to withdraw legitimate unlocked funds and disrupting the protocol's normal operations.

# Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `refundPlayers` function of the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. When refunds are issued for canceled raffles, the function fails to decrease the `_lockedETH` value, which was initially increased during ticket purchases.

There is a requirement for a minimum number of tickets to be sold. If this minimum (set as `minTicketsThreshold` when creating the raffle) is not reached by the end of the raffle period, the raffle can be canceled. This cancellation mechanism is crucial to understanding the vulnerability, as it provides a legitimate path for raffles to be canceled, triggering the refund process.

The `_lockedETH` variable is increased in the `buyTickets` function:

```solidity
function buyTickets(
    uint256 raffleId,
    uint16 ticketCount,
    uint256 blockNumber,
    bytes calldata signature
) external payable {
    // ... (other checks and operations)
    unchecked {
        raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
        _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
        _lockedETH += msg.value;
    }
    // ... (minting tickets and emitting events)
}
```

However, there is no corresponding decrease in `_lockedETH` when refunds are issued. This leads to an ever-increasing `_lockedETH` value that doesn't accurately reflect the actual amount of locked ETH in the contract. The existence of the cancellation mechanism due to insufficient ticket sales exacerbates this issue, as it provides a legitimate and potentially frequent trigger for the refund process, amplifying the discrepancy in the `_lockedETH` value over time.

# Impact

The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for fund lockup in the WinnablesTicketManager contract. As the `_lockedETH` value artificially inflates over time, it can lead to the following consequences:

1. Prevention of Legitimate Withdrawals: The [`withdrawETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L299-L307) function relies on `_lockedETH` to determine the amount of ETH available for withdrawal. As `_lockedETH` grows larger than the actual contract balance, this function will revert due to underflow, preventing any ETH withdrawals.
2. Protocol Disruption: The inflated `_lockedETH` value could interfere with other protocol operations that rely on an accurate representation of locked funds.
3. Griefing Attacks: Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to intentionally inflate `_lockedETH`, disrupting the protocol's ability to manage its ETH holdings correctly. An attacker could repeatedly participate in raffles with minimal ETH, ensure these raffles naturally end up being canceled, and then claim refunds, causing `_lockedETH` to inflate without actually locking any ETH. This process could be automated and executed over an extended period, gradually degrading the protocol's functionality and leading to a complete lockdown of ETH withdrawals, even for legitimate unlocked funds.

Manual Review

# Recommendation

- Update `_lockedETH` in the `refundPlayers` function:

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= amountToSend; // Decrease _lockedETH
        }
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```

- Implement a reconciliation mechanism: Create a function that reconciles the `_lockedETH` value with the actual sum of locked ETH across all active raffles. This function should be called periodically or after significant events (like raffle cancellations).
- Add safety checks: Implement additional checks in critical functions to ensure that `_lockedETH` never exceeds the contract's actual ETH balance.
