# The incorrect Refund handling will lock funds, potentially preventing admin from withdrawing funds

## Summary
The failure to decrement `_lockEth` in the `refundPlayers` function will cause an inability to withdraw funds for the admin in the `withdrawEth` function as the contract will mistakenly believe more Eth is locked than necessary, preventing proper fund release

## Vulnerability Detail
### `WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215-L228`

In `refundPlayers` functon, the `_lockedEth` variable is not decremented when refunds are issued, leading to improper accounting in the contract. Even though it was incremented upon buying of tickets in the  `buyTickets` function.

```solidity
          function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
           Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
           if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
           for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
``` 
## Concept 
1. Two players enter a raffle by purchasing a ticket, assuming the price for a ticket is 5eth. The contract updates the `_lockEth` balance to 10eth
`buyTickets` function increments `_lockedEth` value

```solidity
unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            `_lockedETH += msg.value;`
        }

``` 

2. Assume the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract has an initial balance of 10eth`(address(this))`, as the `_lockedEth` updates this becomes 20eth(current total balance in the contract)
3. Raffle get canceled 
4. player1 asks for a refund by calling `refundPlayers` function but this does not decrement the ` _lockedEth` balance still leaving it inflated as 10eth instead of 5eth
5. `address(this)` updates the total balance of Eth in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract as 15eth
6. Admin attempts to withdraw initial eth by calling the `withdrawEth` function which calculates balance as thus;

```solidity
                function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
                 uint256 balance;
                 unchecked {
                 balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
                    }
                  _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);}

``` 
`15eth - 10eth = 5eth(avaliable balance admin withdraw) instead of 10eth`

## Impact

The admin suffers an approximate loss of value since they are unable to withdraw the full available balance due to incorrect ` _lockedEth` calculation in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract. This restriction prevents admin from accessing funds that should be avaliable for withdrawal when the `withdrawEth` function is called in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract, leading to a potential shortfall in the expected funds under the admin's control. This could impact the contract's operations and fund management

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, ensure that `_lockedEth` is properly decremented within the `refundPlayers` function after each refund is processed. This will guarantee that the locked Eth value accurately reflects the remaining obligatons, preventing any unintended restrictions on the admin's ability to withdraw the correct amount of eth from the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract when the withdrawEth function is called.
use:  `_lockedEth -= amountToSend`
