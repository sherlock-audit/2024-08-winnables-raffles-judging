# Funds stuck in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract

## Summary
Funds stuck in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract due to outdated `_lockedETH` variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
- raffle1 is created
- users are buying tickets: `_lockedETH` = x, `address(this).balance` = x
- raffle is canceled
- players are refunded: `_lockedETH` = x, `address(this).balance` = 0
- raffle2 is created
- users are buying tickets: `_lockedETH` = x + y, `address(this).balance` = y
- winner is drawn and propagated: `_lockedETH` = x, `address(this).balance` = y
- admin tries to call `withdrawETH()`: `balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;` so `balance = y - x` is just the difference between `raffle2.totalRaised` and `raffle1.totalRaised`, but it should be `raffle2.totalRaised`
- The amount of wei stuck in the contract will be equal to `_lockedETH`

## Impact
Funds stuck in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract.

## Recommendation
Fix the bug by making the following change:
```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
+      unchecked {
+            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
+        }
}
```
