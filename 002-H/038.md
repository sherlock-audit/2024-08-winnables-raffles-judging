# Incorrect ETH Locking Mechanism Will Lead to Permanent Fund Lockup (`WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers`)


## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract manages raffles where users can purchase tickets using ETH. The contract employs a mechanism to track locked ETH for potential refunds using the [`_lockedETH` variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L42). This variable is crucial for maintaining the contract's financial integrity and ensuring proper fund management.

The contract correctly increments [`_lockedETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L42) when tickets are purchased in the [`buyTickets()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182-L210):

```solidity
unchecked {
    raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
    _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
    _lockedETH += msg.value;
}
```

However, a critical issue arises in the [`refundPlayers()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215-L228). When a raffle is canceled and players are refunded, the `_lockedETH` variable is not decremented:

```solidity
uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
_sendETH(amountToSend, player);
```

This oversight leads to an artificially inflated `_lockedETH` value over time, as it continues to accumulate without being properly adjusted during refunds.

The `_lockedETH` variable is only decremented in the `propagateRaffleWinner()` function:

```solidity
unchecked {
    _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
}
```

However, this decrement only occurs for successful raffles, not for canceled ones where refunds are issued.

The root cause of this issue lies in the `refundPlayers()` function, where the contract fails to update the `_lockedETH` variable after refunding players. This omission creates a discrepancy between the actual locked ETH and the value stored in `_lockedETH`.

## Impact
The incorrect management of the `_lockedETH` variable can prevent admins from withdrawing legitimate excess funds, leading to potential loss or unavailability of funds. The contract's accounting becomes increasingly inaccurate over time, which can undermine the financial integrity of the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice creates a raffle with 100 ETH as the prize.
2. Bob buys 10 tickets for 1 ETH each. `_lockedETH` is increased by 10 ETH.
3. The raffle is canceled due to insufficient participation.
4. Bob is refunded 10 ETH through the `refundPlayers()` function, but `_lockedETH` remains at 10 ETH.
5. This process repeats for multiple raffles, each time increasing `_lockedETH` without properly decrementing it.
6. Eventually, `_lockedETH` becomes greater than the actual contract balance.
7. When an admin tries to withdraw excess funds using `withdrawETH()`, the transaction reverts due to an underflow or a revert in the calculation `address(this).balance - _lockedETH`.

Manual review


## Recommendation
To address this issue, the `refundPlayers()` function should be modified to decrement `_lockedETH` when refunds are issued. Here's the recommended fix:

```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
+       unchecked {
+           _lockedETH -= amountToSend; // Decrease _lockedETH
+       }
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```

This change ensures that `_lockedETH` accurately reflects the amount of ETH reserved for potential refunds, maintaining the contract's financial integrity and allowing for proper fund management.
