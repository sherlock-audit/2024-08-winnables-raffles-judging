# Players Claiming Refunds in Canceled Raffles Will Cause ETH to Be Stuck in the `WinnablesTicketManager` Contract

### Summary

In the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, the `_lockedETH` variable does not decrease when players are refunded through the `refundPlayers` function after a raffle is canceled, as there is no logic in the function to update `_lockedETH` accordingly. This results in a discrepancy where the contractâ€™s balance becomes less than the `_lockedETH` value. When the `withdrawETH` function is called, it tries to withdraw all available ETH minus `_lockedETH`, but due to the mismatch, the balance calculation underflows, causing the function to revert when it attempts to send the incorrect amount of ETH to the admin.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the lack of logic to adjust the `_lockedETH` variable within the `refundPlayers` function. When players are refunded, the `_lockedETH` variable should be reduced by the amount refunded to accurately reflect the remaining locked funds. Since this adjustment is missing, the `_lockedETH` value remains higher than the actual contract balance, leading to an underflow during the `withdrawETH` function execution.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A raffle is canceled by the admin.
2. A player calls the `refundPlayers` function to receive a refund for their raffle ticket.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The admin cancels a raffle within the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract.
2. A player calls `refundPlayers` to reclaim their ETH from the canceled raffle.
3. The `refundPlayers` function does not adjust the `_lockedETH` variable.
4. The admin later attempts to withdraw ETH using the `withdrawETH` function.
5. The `balance` variable in `withdrawETH` is calculated incorrectly because `_lockedETH` does not reflect the refunded amount.
6. The `balance` calculation overflows, causing the `withdrawETH` function to revert.
7. As a result, all ETH in the contract remains unclaimable, and no further withdrawals are possible.

### Impact

The admin is unable to withdraw ETH from the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract after a player has been refunded, causing any remaining ETH in the contract to become permanently locked. Additionally, all funds deposited from future raffles after the refund will also be trapped, leading to significant financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add these lines in `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` function:
```solidity
    function refundPlayers(
        uint256 raffleId,
        address[] calldata players
    ) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1)
                revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
++       _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
