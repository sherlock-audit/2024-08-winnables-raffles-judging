# The refund didn't deduct the corresponding amount from _lockedETH when canceling raffle

### Summary

When a raffle is canceled and funds are returned to players, the corresponding amount is not deducted from _lockedETH, causing _lockedETH to continually increase. Consequently, when many raffles are canceled, this can prevent the admin from withdraw funds leading to DOS

### Root Cause

When the raffle is canceled, anyone can call `refundPlayers` to get funds back. But the refund didn't deduct the corresponding amount from _lockedETH when refunding players.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Several raffles are canceled
2. Several raffles are drawed
3. The funds which are need to refund players are larger than the funds collected from buyers

### External pre-conditions

When raffle is canceled, `refundPlayers` is immediately called

### Attack Path

```solidity
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```
`address(this).balance` < `_lockedETH` â†’ `withdrawETH` revert
Admin can't withdraw ETH(AVAX).

### Impact

`withdrawETH` is DOS.

### PoC

An example:
1. The ticketManager contract has 100 AVAX and _lockETH = 100
2. raffle A collected 10 AVAX and is canceled. Refund is completed.
3. Now the ticketManager contract has 100 AVAX and _lockETH = 110. Withdraw will be revert.
4. raffle B collected 50 AVAX and is propagated. Now the ticketManager contract has 150 AVAX and _lockETH = 110. The admin forget to withdraw.
5. raffle C collected 100 AVAX and is canceled. Refund is completed. Now the ticketManager contract has 150 AVAX and _lockETH = 210. Withdraw will be revert.
So a DOS for `withdrawETH` could happen.

### Mitigation

```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
+       unchecked {
+           _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
+       } 
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));     
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```
