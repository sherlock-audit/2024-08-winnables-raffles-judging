# LockedEth has a stale value

## Summary

The WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers function does not update the lockedETH variable, leading to inconsistencies.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:

1. **Raffle Deposits**:
   - Raffle 1: 7 ETH deposited
   - Raffle 2: 3 ETH deposited

2. **Post-Raffle Status**:
   - After Raffle 2 ends with a winner, `lockedETH` should decrease from 10 ETH to 7 ETH. The contract balance remains at 10 ETH.
   - If Raffle 1 is canceled and refunds are issued, the contract balance drops to 4 ETH. However, `lockedETH` remains at 7 ETH since it is not updated.

## Impact

In the above scenario, admin will be not able to withdraw their reward from the protocol, because the computation will always underflow in the `withdrawETH`, because 4 - 7 = -3 and this will underflow. Admin couldn't withdraw their reward. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }

....

function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the lockedETH variable is updated appropriately in the refundPlayers function to reflect the actual state of ETH locked in the contract. This can be achieved by decrementing lockedETH every time a eth is withdrawn.
