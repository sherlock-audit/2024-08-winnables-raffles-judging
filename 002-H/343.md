# The `WinnablesTicketManager` inconsistently tracks `_lockedETH`.

## Summary
The `WinnablesTicketManager` inconsistently tracks `_lockedETH`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract uses a global `_lockedETH` variable to track ETH that should be reserved for active raffles or pending refunds. However, this variable is not consistently updated across all relevant functions, particularly in the `refundPlayers` function.

The inconsistency arises from the following issues:
1. The `buyTickets` function increases `_lockedETH` when tickets are purchased.
2. The `refundPlayers` function issues refunds but fails to decrease `_lockedETH`.
3. The `withdrawETH` function calculates available ETH based on `_lockedETH`, which can lead to underflows.
4. The `propagateRaffleWinner` function decreases `_lockedETH` based on potentially inconsistent data.

This leads to a scenario where `_lockedETH` becomes higher than the actual amount of ETH that should be locked, causing issues in fund management.

## Impact
The vulnerability can lead to severalissues:
 - Denial of Service: The contract may enter a state where `withdrawETH` always reverts, preventing any ETH withdrawal.
 - Incorrect raffle operations: Future raffles may operate with incorrect assumptions about available funds.
 - Loss of user funds: Users may be unable to claim refunds or prizes due to incorrect ETH accounting.

@WinnablesTicketManager.sol
```solidity
function buyTickets(...) external payable {
    // ...
    unchecked {
        _lockedETH += msg.value;
    }
    // ...
}

function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    // ...
    _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
    // Note: _lockedETH is not updated here
    // ...
}

function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
    uint256 balance;
    unchecked {
        balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
    }
    _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
}

function propagateRaffleWinner(...) external {
    // ...
    unchecked {
        _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the locked ETH amount in all relevant functions:
```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    // ...
    _raffleLockedETH[raffleId] -= amountToSend;
    _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
    // ...
}
```
