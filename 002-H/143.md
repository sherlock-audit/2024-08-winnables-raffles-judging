# Failure to update `_lockedETH` in `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` function leads to potential fund locking

## Summary

Due to a parallel tracking of actual ETH balance of the contract and the funds locked in raffles, lacking subtraction of released ETH from the variable tracking locked ETH when refunding players may cause future withdrawals of protocol's funds to fail. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` refunds players for canceled raffles but fails to update the `_lockedETH` variable. This oversight can lead to a discrepancy between the actual contract balance and the tracked locked ETH, potentially causing issues with future withdrawals.

## Impact

`WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawETH` relies on the `_lockedETH` variable to determine how much ETH can be withdrawn. If `_lockedETH` is not decreased during refunds, it will remain artificially high, preventing the withdrawal of legitimately available funds.

## Code Snippet

[WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L223-L224](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L223-L224)

This can be exploited or cause issues in the following scenario:

- A raffle is canceled, and players are eligible for refunds.
- `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` is called multiple times, refunding ETH to players.
- The contract's actual ETH balance decreases, but `_lockedETH` remains unchanged.
- When trying to withdraw ETH using the `WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawETH` function, the available balance calculation `address(this).balance - _lockedETH` may result in an underflow or prevent legitimate withdrawals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` function to decrease `_lockedETH` when refunding players. Additionally, consider adding a safety check to ensure `_lockedETH` doesn't underflow:

```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    // ... existing code ...

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length;) {
        // ... existing code ...

        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
+       require(_lockedETH >= amountToSend, "Insufficient locked ETH");
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
+       _lockedETH -= amountToSend;

        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
}
```
