# in `winnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()` refunded eth is not deducted from `_lockedETH`.

## Summary
refunded eth isn't deducted from the state var that stores ETH locked in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
`_lockedETH` is the state var in `winnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()` that is used to account for ETH locked in the contract
```solidity
   /// @dev ETH locked in the contract because it might be needed for a refund
    uint256 private _lockedETH;
```

When tickets are bought via `buyTickets()`, ETH used to buy tickets are added to `_lockedETH`.
```solidity
    unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value; // @audit here
        }
```

The issue lies in `refundPlayers()` which fails to deduct refunded ETH from `_lockedETH` state var. 
```solidity
  function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }//@audit-issue refunded eth is not deducted from _lockedETH.

```

This will mess up the accounting of the contract.

## Impact
refunded eth is not deducted from `_lockedETH`, the accounting of the contract will be messed up (incorrect accounting)

Deduct refunded ETH from `_lockedETH` in  `winnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()`
