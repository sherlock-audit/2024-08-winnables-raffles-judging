# Failure to update `_lockedETH` during refunds causes inaccurate revenue withdrawals

## Summary
The `_lockedETH` variable is not updated during refunds, leading to an inflated value that prevents admins from correctly withdrawing future sales revenue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_lockedETH` variable represents the amount of ETH locked in the contract [due to ticket purchases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L206). It is used to ensure that the ETH associated with current unfinished raffles is not included in the sales revenue of past raffles during withdrawals:
```solidity
/// @notice (Admin) Withdraw ETH from a canceled raffle or ticket sales
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
    uint256 balance;
    unchecked {
        balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH; 
    }
    _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
}
```
However, the `_lockedETH` value is not updated when a refund occurs due to raffle cancellation:
```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```
As seen above, when a refund occurs, the `_lockedETH` amount is not decremented. This leads to an inflated `_lockedETH` value, preventing the admin from withdrawing future sales revenue equal to the excess amount in `_lockedETH`. Consider the following example:
1. Raffle 1 is created with a minimum tickets threshold of `400`.
2. Buyer 1 purchases `100` tickets for `0.5 ETH`, and Buyer 2 purchases `150` tickets for `0.75 ETH`.
3. The raffle period ends without reaching the minimum tickets threshold (only 250 tickets are sold), leading to the raffle's cancellation.
4. Both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2 are refunded via `refundPlayers(1, [buyer1.address, buyer2.address])`. Note that during this transaction, `_lockedETH` is NOT updated.
5. Depending on subsequent scenarios:
    5.1 If a new raffle is created and successfully ends with sales revenue greater than `_lockedETH`, say for example `1 ETH`, the admin attempts to withdraw the `1 ETH`. However, only `0.25 ETH` will be withdrawn:
    ```solidity
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH; // @audit balance = 1 ETH - 0.75 ETH = 0.25 ETH
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
    ```
    5.2 If a new raffle is created and successfully ends with sales revenue less than `_lockedETH`say for example `0.5 ETH`, the admin's withdrawal attempt will result in an underflow, causing the withdrawal to revert because the contract does not hold sufficient balance:
    ```solidity
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
    >>>       balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH; // @audit Underflow: 0.5 ETH - 0.75 ETH
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
    ```
## Impact
Admins will be unable to withdraw the correct sales revenue, leading to financial loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update `_lockedETH` during the refund process. Below is a suggested modification to the `refundPlayers` function:
```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
     for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
+       _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```
