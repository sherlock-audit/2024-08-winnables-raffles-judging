# lockedEth is not being decrease when refunding

## Summary

`_lockedETH` is not being decreased in `refundPlayers`, leading to differences between it and the native balance of `WinnablesTicketManager`. As a result `withdrawETH` will lead to underflow when `_lockedETH` becomes higher than the `address(this).balance`, as the subtraction is performed in unchecked block, that will cause permanent reverts in `_sendETH`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When raffle is being cancelled all the players that have purchased tickets must be refunded from `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers`:

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```

The problem is that `_lockedETH` is not decreased which leads to becoming out-of-sync with the native balance.

Later on when the admin wants to withdraw the `ETH` that is accumulated from the tickets due to the difference between the 2 underflow will be cause making the `withdrawETH` DOS permanently:

```solidity
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
      uint256 balance;
      unchecked {
          balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
      }
      _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
  }
```

This will also impact the amount of `ETH` that the owner will be able to withdraw, which means there is a loss of funds, since this is the revenue of the protocol.

## Impact

DOS of `withdrawETH` when players are being refunded.

Here is a POC (in order to make it work you should have configured Foundry version of the project):
