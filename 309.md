# Incorrect Validation Logic in `WinnablesPrizeManager::_checkValidRaffle` will Lead to Disruption of Valid Raffle Operations

### Summary

The incorrect validation [logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L251-L256) in `WinnablesPrizeManager::_checkValidRaffle` will cause disruption of valid raffle operations for users as the function erroneously identifies valid raffles as invalid. This flaw will cause legitimate raffles to be flagged as invalid and prevent users from participating or claiming prizes, leading to operational disruption.

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:_checkValidRaffle`, the [condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L254) intended to identify invalid raffles is implemented incorrectly:
```solidity
    function _checkValidRaffle(uint256 raffleId) internal view returns(RafflePrize storage) {
        if (raffleId == 0) revert IllegalRaffleId();
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
@>      if (rafflePrize.raffleType != RaffleType.NONE) revert InvalidRaffleId();
        return rafflePrize;
    }
```
The function incorrectly reverts when the `raffleType` is `not NONE`, which leads to valid raffles being treated as invalid.
Here `NONE` basicly means it's uninitialized.
aka: "I've never heard of that raffle ID"

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The function `_checkValidRaffle(raffleId)` is called to validate a raffle.
2. The `_rafflePrize` mapping contains a `RafflePrize` structure for the given `raffleId`.
3. If the `raffleId` is valid, the `raffleType` will be set to `NFT or ETH or TOKEN` 
4. If the `raffleId` is not valid or not initialised yet, the `raffleType` will be set to `NONE`
5. The `raffleType` is set to a value other than `RaffleType.NONE` if it has been initialised

### External pre-conditions

1. The system relies on `_checkValidRaffle` to validate raffles before performing operations on them.
2. Proper validation of raffle types is critical to ensuring the correct functioning of raffle-related operations.

### Attack Path

1. **Raffle Initialization:**
    - A raffle is initialized and stored in the `_rafflePrize` mapping.
    - The `raffleType` is correctly set during initialization.
2. **Validation Failure:**
    - When `_checkValidRaffle(raffleId)` is called, it incorrectly checks whether the `raffleType` is not `NONE`.
    - If the `raffleType` is valid (i.e., not `NONE`), the function `erroneously reverts`, treating the valid raffle as invalid.
    - This results in the inability to perform legitimate operations on valid raffles.
3. **Disruption of Operations:**
    - Due to the incorrect validation logic, legitimate raffles cannot proceed through their intended workflows.
    - This can lead to disruptions in the raffle process, including preventing users from participating in valid raffles or claiming prizes.

### Impact

- **Operational Disruption:** Legitimate raffles may be incorrectly flagged as invalid, preventing users from participating or claiming prizes. This can disrupt the overall raffle process.
- **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose confidence in the system if valid raffles are consistently flagged as invalid, leading to frustration and potential financial losses.
- **Security Concerns:** Although this is not a direct security vulnerability, the incorrect validation logic can cause significant operational issues, which may indirectly impact the system's security and reliability.

### PoC

Here is a simplified example showing how the bug manifests:
```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract RaffleTest is Test {
    error IllegalRaffleId();
    error InvalidRaffleId();

    enum RaffleType { NONE, NFT, ETH, TOKEN }
    struct RafflePrize {
        RaffleType raffleType;
        // other fields...
    }

    mapping(uint256 => RafflePrize) private _rafflePrize;

    function setUp() public {
        // Set up a valid raffle
        _rafflePrize[1] = RafflePrize(RaffleType.ETH);
    }

    function _checkValidRaffle(uint256 raffleId) internal view returns(RafflePrize storage) {
        if (raffleId == 0) revert IllegalRaffleId();
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        if (rafflePrize.raffleType != RaffleType.NONE) revert InvalidRaffleId(); // Incorrect logic
        return rafflePrize;
    }

    function testCheckValidRaffle() public {
        vm.expectRevert(bytes4(keccak256("InvalidRaffleId()")));
        _checkValidRaffle(1); // Should pass but fails due to incorrect logic
    }
}
```
Run this test using: `forge test --mt testCheckValidRaffle -vvvvv`

**Output:**
```javascript
Ran 1 test for test/RaffleValidationCheck.t.sol:RaffleTest
[PASS] testCheckValidRaffle() (gas: 5371)
Traces:
  [22419] RaffleTest::setUp()
    └─ ← [Stop] 

  [5371] RaffleTest::testCheckValidRaffle()
    ├─ [0] VM::expectRevert(InvalidRaffleId())
    │   └─ ← [Return] 
    └─ ← [Revert] InvalidRaffleId()

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped;
```


### Mitigation

To fix the issue, the function should properly validate raffles by checking if the `raffleType` is `NONE`. The corrected function is:

```diff
function _checkValidRaffle(uint256 raffleId) internal view returns(RafflePrize storage) {
    if (raffleId == 0) revert IllegalRaffleId();
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
-   if (rafflePrize.raffleType != RaffleType.NONE) revert InvalidRaffleId();
+   if (rafflePrize.raffleType == RaffleType.NONE) revert InvalidRaffleId(); // Correct logic
    return rafflePrize;
}

```

This change ensures that only raffles with a `raffleType` of `NONE` (which are invalid) will trigger the `InvalidRaffleId` error, allowing valid raffles to proceed as intended.
