# missing nonreentrance guard for eth transfer procedure function - 0XALIYAH

## Summary

0xaliyah

1. _sendETHPrize is visited on line 118 WinnablesPrizeManager
2. winner.call transfers the eth and without specified gas limit and the recipient will gain the opportunity to reenter and cause loss due to the _ethLocked is deducted from non raffleId specific balance and balance that belongs to 1 locked balance:* prize winners

```

1. attacker had to wait till _ethLocked  > _ethRaffles[raffleId] since there is no expiry or timeout for any prizes
2. given the protocol allows participants to be a smart contract
3. Calls the claimPrize function, triggering the _sendETHPrize call initially then from the recipient contract's fallback function. reenters the claimPrize function, potentially before the the initial claimPrize invoke has completed.
