# Missing existence check in `buyTickets` function, lead to financial discrepancies for participants

### Summary

The missing existence check in [`WinnablesTicketManager.sol :: buyTickets`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182)
 for `RaffleStatus.NONE` will cause `financial discrepancies for participants` as an `attacker or user` will provide a non-existent `raffleId`, causing the system to access uninitialized storage and potentially leading to overpayment or underpayment for tickets.

### Root Cause

In the `buyTickets` function and its dependencies, the code does not explicitly check if the raffle status is `RaffleStatus.NONE`.
- [`_checkTicketPurchaseable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L189)
: This function is responsible for ensuring that the raffle is in a valid state before proceeding with ticket purchases.

### Internal pre-conditions

 
1. The `raffle.status` must be other than `RaffleStatus.NONE`.

 
2. The `raffle.startsAt` must be at most `block.timestamp` and `raffle.status` must be exactly `RaffleStatus.IDLE`.


3. The `ticketPurchased + ticketCount` must be at most `raffle.maxHoldings` and `supply + ticketCount` must be at most `raffle.maxTicketSupply`.


### External pre-conditions

There are no external preconditions required for the attack path to happen. The issue is internal to the contract logic and does not depend on external conditions.

### Attack Path



1. The attacker calls the `buyTickets` function with a `raffleId` that corresponds to a non-existent raffle (i.e., the raffle status is `RaffleStatus.NONE`).


2. The `buyTickets` function calls `_checkTicketPurchaseable`, which accesses `_raffles[raffleId]` without explicitly checking if the raffle status is `RaffleStatus.NONE`.


3. Since `_checkTicketPurchaseable` does not verify the existence of the raffle, it proceeds to check other properties of the uninitialized `Raffle` struct, leading to accessing uninitialized storage.

4. The function retrieves default values from the uninitialized `Raffle` struct, such as `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `minTicketsThreshold`, `maxTicketSupply`, `maxHoldings`, `totalRaised`, and `chainlinkRequestId`.

5. The attacker may overpay or underpay for tickets due to the misleading information retrieved from the uninitialized `Raffle` struct, resulting in financial discrepancies for participants.

6. The `buyTickets` function completes the ticket purchase process based on the misleading information, including minting tickets and updating metadata.


### Impact

- Affected Party: Participants of the raffle.

- Loss: Participants may overpay or underpay for tickets, leading to financial discrepancies.

- Attacker's Gain: The attacker gains an unfair advantage by exploiting the missing existence check, allowing them to manipulate the ticket purchase process based on misleading information.

### PoC

see above attack path!

### Mitigation

- Add an explicit check to ensure the raffle status is not `RaffleStatus.NONE` before proceeding with other validations in `function _checkTicketPurchaseable`
