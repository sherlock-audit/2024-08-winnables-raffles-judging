# Admins can influence the odds of raffles

## Summary
Admins can influence the odds of a raffle by minting additional tickets after the random word is fulfilled by Chainlink VRF. This breaks the core invariant that admins should not influence raffle odds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contest readme explicitly states that admins should not have any means to influence the odds of a raffle:
> The principles that must always remain true are: 
> - **Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle**

The raffle winner is determined after the Chainlink VRF fulfills the random word, with the winner calculated based on the random word and the raffle's ticket supply using the formula `randomWord % supply`:
```solidity
function _getWinnerByRequestId(uint256 requestId) internal view returns(address) {
    RequestStatus storage request = _chainlinkRequests[requestId];
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(request.raffleId);
>>>    uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply;
    return IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).ownerOf(request.raffleId, winningTicketNumber);
}
```
The issue is that after the random word is fulfilledâ€”meaning after the [fulfillRandomWords](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L350-L361) function is called and the random word is known. At this point, the admin can determine the random word and exploit it by calling the [WinnablesTicket::mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182-L199) function to mint additional tickets. By increasing the ticket supply, the admin can manipulate the outcome of the raffle, thereby controlling who wins:
```solidity
// WinnablesTicket::mint
function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
    // ...

    unchecked {
      _balances[id][to] += amount;
>>>      _supplies[id] = startId + amount;
    }

    _ticketOwnership[id][startId] = to;
    // ...
}
```
## Impact
Core invariant is broken: Admins can influence the odds of a raffle

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider restricting the `WinnablesTicket::mint` function so that it can only be called by the `WinnablesTicketManager`.
