# [Low] `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::claimPrize()` checks if msg.sender is winner or not after sending the prize.


**Description:** `claimPrize()` transfer the prize according to `RaffleType` then check msg.sender is winner or not : line 105 - 123

**Impact:** If `RaffleType` is ETH, the contract make an external call to msg.sender, in some cases this could be a smart contract with malicious intentions.

```solidity
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim(); : line 120
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Make sure the caller of the function is the winner first.
