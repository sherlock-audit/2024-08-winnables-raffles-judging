# Anyone can call `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` with incorrect arguments causing the inability to unlock the raffle prize

### Summary

Once all conditions for canceling a raffle are met `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` can be called with incorrect `prizeManager` or `chainSelector` causing the raffle status to become `RaffleStatus.CANCELED` and therefore dissallowing anyone to cancel the raffle again with correct arguments and therefore locking the prize forever.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278 the function is missing a modifier allowing only admins to call this function. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There must be a raffle that meets the criteria to be cancelled
2. Before admin or anyone else manages to call the `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` with correct arguments to unlock the prize a malicious actor must call the function with incorrect argumets (but correct raffle ID)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor will attempt to call `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` with incorrect arguments if the raffle is to be cancelled. If he manages to call it before anyone else he will cause losses for the protocol.

### Impact

- The admins suffer a loss of the raffle prize that should have been unlocked after `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()` was called.

### PoC

PoC is done by modifying the already existing tests here:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/TicketManager.js#L272
The first tests of the following two comes through even though it is send to the incorrect chain, `chainSelector` is set to 137 instead of 1. Afterwards if someone attempts to call it with the correct arguments to actually unlock the prizes for admins in `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract it is no longer possible causing the ETH/NFT/tokens to be stuck forever.

```js
it("Cancels and sends cancellation CCIP Message", async () => {
      expect(await manager.shouldCancelRaffle(1)).to.eq(true);
      await manager.cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 137, 1);
    });

    it("Cancels and sends cancellation CCIP Message", async () => {
      expect(await manager.shouldCancelRaffle(1)).to.eq(true);
      await manager.cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1);
    });
```

### Mitigation

A modifier allowing only admins to call this function should be added. Another option would be would be storing the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` as storage variable with setter only allowed to be called by admins and these storage variables being referenced inside of `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()`.
