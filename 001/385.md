# Overflow  in `mint` Function of `WinnablesTicket.sol`

## Summary

In `WinnablesTicket` Contract on `mint` function, the `amount` parameter is an externally controlled value. The unchecked block performs arithmetic operations without overflow checks

## Vulnerability Detail

The `mint` function allows the minting of tokens by adjusting the balances and supplies. The function includes an unchecked block where arithmetic operations on user-controlled values `amount` are performed:

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
     ......
unchecked {
 @>  _balances[id][to] += amount; 
 @> _supplies[id] = startId + amount;
}
```
Since the operations inside the unchecked block do not include overflow checks, if amount is sufficiently large, it can lead to integer overflow. This could result in incorrect balance or supply values.


## Impact

The potential overflow could have the following impacts:

- Incorrect Token Balances: Overflow in `_balances[id][to]` may lead to erroneous token balances, allowing users to mint more tokens than intended.
- Supply Tracking Issues: Overflow in `_supplies[id]` could disrupt the tracking of total supply, affecting the contract's overall integrity and potentially enabling further exploits.
