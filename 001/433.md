# Critical Access Control Vulnerability in claimPrize Function Allows Unauthorized Prize Claims

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in the `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` smart contract contains a severe access control vulnerability. The function performs prize distribution actions before verifying if the caller is the legitimate winner. This allows any address to claim prizes for any raffle, potentially draining the contract of its assets

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is in the claimPrize function:
```solidity 
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = *rafflePrize[raffleId];
    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
    
    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        NFTInfo storage raffle = *nftRaffles[raffleId];
        *nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
        *sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        TokenInfo storage raffle = *tokenRaffles[raffleId];
        unchecked {
            *tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount;
        }
        *sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        unchecked {
            *ethLocked -= *ethRaffles[raffleId];
        }
        *sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();

    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```
The critical issue is that the function performs the prize distribution (sending NFTs, tokens, or ETH) before checking if the caller (msg.sender) is the legitimate winner. The check if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim(); is performed after the prizes have already been sent.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe:

Any address can claim prizes for any raffle, regardless of whether they are the actual winner.
The contract's assets (NFTs, tokens, and ETH) can be drained by malicious actors.
Legitimate winners may be unable to claim their prizes if they've already been claimed by an attacker.
The integrity of the entire raffle system is compromised, potentially leading to financial losses and loss of trust in the platform.

## Tools Used
Manual code Review 

## Recommendations

Move the winner and claimed status checks to the beginning of the function:

solidityCopyfunction claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = *rafflePrize[raffleId];
    
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
    
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
