# In `WinnablesTicketManager`, an attacker can prevent CCIP messages in `cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner` from being sent to `prizeManager` in the destination chain

### Summary

In `WinnablesTicketManager`, `prizeManager` is taken as an input argument in 
`cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner` which will cause the CCIP messages can not be sent to `prizeManager` in the destination chain as an attacker will set the wrong `prizeManager`.

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicketManager`, `prizeManager` is taken as an input argument in 
`cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner`

### Attack Path

1. In `WinnablesTicketManager`, an attacker will set `prizeManager` in `cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner` to the wrong address. The attacker can pay higher gas to guarantee the malicious transaction will be executed before the honest transaction (the transaction that call to `cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner` with correct `prizeManager`)
2. In `cancelRaffle`, because the `_raffles[raffleId].status` is set to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED`, no one can call `cancelRaffle` for the raffle with `raffleId` again to resend the CCIP message.
3. In `propagateRaffleWinner`, because the `_raffles[raffleId].status` is set to `RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED`, no one can call `propagateRaffleWinner` for the raffle with `raffleId` again to resend the CCIP message.

### Impact

If the `prizeManager` in the destination chain does not receive CCIP message then:
- For `cancelRaffle`, the raffle is not cancelled, which will cause the locked prize can not be claimed back.
- For `propagateRaffleWinner`, because `_rafflePrize[raffleId].winner` is not set, the winner can not call `WinnablesPrizeManager#claimPrize` to claim the prize.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. In `WinnablesTicketManager`, remove the `prizeManager` from the input arguments in `cancelRaffle` and `propagateRaffleWinner`.
2. Make `prizeManager` into a storage variable, which can only be set by the admin.
