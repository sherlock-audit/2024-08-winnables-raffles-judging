# [Medium]  WinnablesPrizeManager.sol reentrancy attack

### Summary

The missing reentrancy guard in WinnablesPrizeManager.sol will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker will re-enter the claimPrize function to drain the contract’s balance.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:207](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L142-L162), there is a missing reentrancy guard on the claimPrize function, allowing multiple calls before state changes are committed.

```solidity
   function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1.	The attacker needs to have won a raffle (rafflePrize.winner) to set msg.sender to be the authorized claimer.
2.	The rafflePrize.status must be NOT_CLAIMED.
3.	The _ethLocked, must have sufficient balance to fulfill the prize.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.	The attacker calls claimPrize() and passes the conditions to claim the prize.
2.	In the process of claiming, the contract sends the prize (ETH) to the attacker’s address.
3.	During the prize transfer, the attacker’s contract re-enters the claimPrize() function by leveraging the receive() fallback function.
4.	The contract has not yet marked the raffle as claimed (rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED), so the attacker can call claimPrize() multiple times in quick succession.
5.	The attacker drains the contract’s balance by continuously re-entering the function.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of all funds locked in raffles. The attacker gains the entire value of all the prizes that were meant to be distributed to winners.
