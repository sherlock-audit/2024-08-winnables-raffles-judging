# Irreversible State Change Due to Incorrect Parameters in Cross-Chain Winner Propagation

### Summary

The `propagateRaffleWinner` function in the TicketManager contract is external and vulnerable to irreversible state changes if called with incorrect `chainSelector` or `prizeManager` address parameters. This can lead to a situation where the raffle is marked as completed on the TicketManager, but the winner information never reaches the PrizeManager, potentially leaving prizes unclaimed and the system in an inconsistent state.

### Root Cause

In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334), The function updates the local state (marking the raffle as `PROPAGATED` and decreasing _lockedETH) before ensuring the CCIP message is successfully sent to the right address.
There's no validation of the chainSelector or prizeManager address parameters, allowing calls with incorrect values that will fail to reach the intended PrizeManager contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A raffle must have a winner drawn (status FULFILLED).
2. The `propagateRaffleWinner` function must be callable by any address (no access control).

### External pre-conditions

Malicious Person will call the function using his own adress for `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`.


### Attack Path

1. A raffle concludes, and a winner is drawn (status set to FULFILLED).
2. An actor (malicious or mistaken) calls propagateRaffleWinner with incorrect chainSelector or his own malicious prizeManager address.
3. The TicketManager updates the raffle status to PROPAGATED.
4. The _lockedETH is decreased by the raffle's totalRaised amount.
5. The CCIP message is sent but fails to reach the correct PrizeManager due to incorrect parameters.
6. The raffle is now in a PROPAGATED state on TicketManager, but PrizeManager never receives the winner information.
7. There's no mechanism to revert this state or retry the winner propagation because the function will revert due to status being PROPAGATED and not FULFILLED .

### Impact

1. The raffle is incorrectly marked as completed on the TicketManager.
2. Funds are locked in the `WinnablesPrizeManager`
3. Potential financial loss for the legitimate winner who can't claim their prize.

### PoC

1.Initial Setup:
-WinnablesTicketManager contract is deployed on Chain A (e.g., Avalanche).
-WinnablesPrizeManager contract is deployed on Chain B (e.g., Ethereum).
-Both contracts are properly set up and linked.


2.Create and Run a Raffle:

-Create Raffle A.
-Users purchase tickets for Raffle A, totaling 10 ETH.
-The _lockedETH in TicketManager is now 10 ETH.


3.Raffle Conclusion:

-The raffle end time is reached.
-An authorized user calls the drawWinner function for Raffle A.
- Chainlink VRF provides a random number, and the winner is determined, the raffle status is set to FULFILLED.


4.Incorrect Winner Propagation:

An actor (could be anyone, as there's no access control on propagateRaffleWinner) calls the function with incorrect parameters:
```solidity`
ticketManager.propagateRaffleWinner(
    maliciousOrIncorrectAddress,  // Instead of the correct PrizeManager address, adress for a malicious contract that is maybe able to receive CCIP message
    incorrectChainSelector ,       // A chain selector  for the malicious prizeManager
    raffleAId
)```



5.TicketManager State Changes:

-The propagateRaffleWinner function doesn't verify the prizeManager address or chainSelector.
-It updates the raffle status from FULFILLED to PROPAGATED.
-It decreases _lockedETH by 10 ETH (the totalRaised for Raffle A).
-A CCIP message is sent with the incorrect parameters.


7-Failed Cross-Chain Communication:

The CCIP message fails to reach the correct PrizeManager due to the incorrect address or chain selector.
The correct PrizeManager on Chain B never receives the winner information.


8-Final State:

-On TicketManager (Chain A):

Raffle A status: PROPAGATED
_lockedETH: Decreased by 10 ETH
Winner information: Known locally but not propagated correctly


-On PrizeManager (Chain B):

No update received
Prize still locked and unclaimed




Attempt to Rectify:

An admin or the legitimate winner notices the prize hasn't been made claimable on Chain B.
They attempt to call propagateRaffleWinner again with the correct parameters.
The function reverts because the raffle status is already PROPAGATED, not FULFILLED.
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }```

Consequences:

The legitimate winner cannot claim their prize on Chain B.
The prize  is stuck in the PrizeManager contract.
The _lockedETH on TicketManager has been decreased, potentially allowing premature withdrawal of funds.
There's no built-in mechanism to revert the raffle to its previous state or retry the propagation.
### Mitigation

Implement parameter validation:
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
    require(_validPrizeManagers[chainSelector][prizeManager], "Invalid PrizeManager or chainSelector");
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
