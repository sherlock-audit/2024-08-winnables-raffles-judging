# A malicious admin can exploit the system

## Summary
Malicious admins can steal the prize from any raffle or prevent a raffle from getting canceled, making users' funds stuck

## Vulnerability Detail
As the contest's README states, 
"The principles that must always remain true are:
- Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize
- Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded
- Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle"

However, this is not exactly true, since a malicious admin could approve his own malicious contract using WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::`setCCIPCounterpart()` function and send forged messages from his contract to the PrizeManager, which could either:

- Steal any locked prize by sending a message which consists of `CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN`, `raffleId` and his address
- Prevent a raffle from getting canceled on Avalanche by sending a forged message which consists of `CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED` and `raffleId`, which makes the function `cancelRaffle()` on Avalanche contract revert and a raffle to get stuck with users' funds.

```solidity
function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();

        CCIPMessageType messageType = CCIPMessageType(uint8(message.data[0]));
        uint256 raffleId;
        address winner;
        if (messageType == CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED) {
            raffleId = _decodeRaffleCanceledMessage(message.data);
            _cancelRaffle(raffleId);
            return;
        }
        (raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
        _rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
        emit WinnerPropagated(raffleId, winner);
    }
```
```solidity
function _cancelRaffle(uint256 raffleId) internal {
        RaffleType raffleType = _rafflePrize[raffleId].raffleType;
        if (_rafflePrize[raffleId].status == RafflePrizeStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        . . .
        _rafflePrize[raffleId].status = RafflePrizeStatus.CANCELED;
        emit PrizeUnlocked(raffleId);
    }
```
```solidity
function setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }
```
```solidity
function _setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) internal {
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(contractAddress, chainSelector);
        _ccipContracts[counterpart] = enabled;
    }
```

## Impact
Malicious admins could abuse the system by stealing prizes or making users' funds stuck in the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check that doesn't let admins set multiple CCIPCounterparts since there's only 1 contract on both Ethereum and Avalanche that sends cross-chain messages.
