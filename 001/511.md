# Winners can drain the entire ETH in the contract due to a reentrancy vulnerability

## Summary
The winner can drain the entire ETH in the contract due to a reentrancy vulnerability

## Vulnerability Detail
The claimPrize() function allows the rightful winner of a raffle Id to withdraw just the amount for that particular raffle, however, for the ETH raffle type, the winner can claim the entire ETH in the contract. This is because before updating the status to CLAIMED, it makes a low-level external call back to the winner as a result of the .call() operator sending the ETH amount:
```solidity
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
@>          _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
@>      rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```
```solidity
function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
@>      (bool success, ) = winner.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
```
This allows the winner to reenter the contract and call claimPrize() again thereby claiming the amount multiple times before the status gets updated leading to the draining of the ETH in the contract.

## Impact
winners can drain the entire ETH in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform the status update before sending the amount or add a reentrancy guard.
```diff
+       rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
                 ...
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
-       rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```
