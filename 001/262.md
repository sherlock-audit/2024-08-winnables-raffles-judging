# Misplaced Winner Check  in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function, causes everyone can claimPrizes

## Description

In the `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function, the validation to ensure that the caller is the actual winner of the raffle occurs after the prize has already been transferred. This sequence does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, where checks should occur before any state changes or external calls. As a result, an unauthorized user could exploit this vulnerability to claim the prize without being the legitimate winner.

## Impact

An unauthorized user could falsely claim prizes intended for the actual raffle winners. This could result in significant financial loss, damage to the protocolâ€™s reputation, and loss of trust from users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rearrange the code to follow the CEI pattern by moving the validation of the winner to the beginning of the function.
