# CreateRaffle() can be DoS by frontrunning

## Summary
CreateRaffle() can be DoS by frontrunning

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin creates raffle in tokenManager:createRaffle() when prize for that raffle is locked ie PRIZE_LOCKED. Also a user can cancel a raffle using cancelRaffle() & it doesn't revert when status of the raffle is PRIZE_LOCKED
```solidity
function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);
...
    }
```
```solidity
 function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
-->     if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
...
    }
```
This is where a malicious user will frontrun the createRaffle() by cancelRaffle().  cancelRaffle() will not revert as status of raffle is PRIZE_LOCKED. This will mark the status of raffle to be CANCELED, so when createRaffle() will execute, it will revert due to status error

## Impact
CreateRaffle() can be DoS every time admin tries to create raffle
