# _lockedETH is not decreased on refunding players in WinnablesTicketManager contract

## Summary

Storage variable `_lockedETH` is not decreased when refunding players.

## Vulnerability Detail

The storage variable that keeps track of how much ether must be locked on the contract is not decreased when users are refunded. This means `_lockedETH` variable does not correctly represent the amount of ether that is presumably locked for various purposes. Balance of ether on the contract can be less than `_lockedETH` value. This can cause underflow in `withdrawETH` function.
Note - Auction must be canceled in order to be able to refund players. 

## Impact

There will be an underflow in `withdrawETH` function when calculating available ether to withdraw. So that function will become unusable.

Admin can't withdraw funds made from ticket sales.

## POC

1. Make `_lockedETH` variable public -> `uint256 public _lockedETH;`
2. Add these lines at the end of TicketManager.js - `'Should be able to refund tickets purchased'` unit test:

```javascript
const lockedETH = await manager._lockedETH();
expect(lockedETH).to.be.greaterThan(contractBalanceAfter);
console.log('Contract balance:', contractBalanceAfter.toString());
console.log('lockedETH variable: ', lockedETH);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Decrease `_lockedETH` variable with value refunded from the contract:

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        _lockedETH -= amountToSend; // @audit added this line
        _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```
