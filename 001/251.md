# Protocol Eth can be drained via reentrancy

## Summary
claimPrize function sends Eth to winners before updating rafflePrizeStatus state thereby exposing the protocol to reentrancy attack


## Vulnerability Detail
After raffle is completed , winner are expected to claim thier prizes

In the claimPrize  implementation, winnings are sent to users before the rafflePrize.status is being updated. 

This exposes the function to reentrancy if the winning prize are in Eth allowing malicious smart contract callback into the protocol multiple times and drain the entire protocol Eth. 


Scenerio

After raffle has ended . 

1. Malicious winner which is a smart contract calls the claimPrize, setting the contract to callback into the claimPrize or refund function after he receives Eth 

2. Calls claimPrize, drains the Eth in the contract via reentrancy


## Impact
Protocol Eth can be drained completely
