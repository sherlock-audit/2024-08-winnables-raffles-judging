# An attacker can prevent the raffle from being created by exploiting permissionless raffle cancellation

### Summary

In `WinnablesTicketManager`, permissionless raffle cancellation will cause the raffles can not be created as an attacker will cancel the raffle right after the CCIP message is received from the prize manager.

### Root Cause

Permissionless raffle cancellation. Since the check for the raffle can be cancelled will pass if the raffle's status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`
