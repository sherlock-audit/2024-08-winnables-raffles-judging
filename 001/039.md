# Raffle cancellation can be front-run to lock assets on Ethereum

## Summary

The [WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) function can be front-run by malicious actors to lock assets on Ethereum.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) function lacks proper access control and input validation for the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` parameters. A malicious actor can front-run the legitimate cancellation by calling `cancelRaffle()` with a fake `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`.

When this happens, the cancellation message is sent to an incorrect contract, preventing the `WinnablesPrizeManager` on Ethereum from [receiving the `RAFFLE_CANCELED` message](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L270-L274) and execute the `_cancelRaffle()` logic. As a result, the raffle remains active on Ethereum, but it is effectively canceled on the Avalanche. This results in locking the assets associated with the canceled raffle, as the admin [cannot withdraw them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L245).

## Impact

The admin will be unable to withdraw the assets associated with the canceled raffle.
