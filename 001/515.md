# [Medium] `WinnablesTicketManager.sol::withdrawTokens()` is unusable.

**Description:** The function takes in `tokenAddress` to get the balance of the token in this contract so it can transfer to the admin. Then takes in the `amount` of token to transfer to user.  However it will revert if the amount is less than the balance.

```javascript
    if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); line 295
```

This function is totally unusable since it reverts if amount is less than balance and if amount is greater than balance, the transfer will fail since there isn't enough funds.

```solidity
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount); line 296
```

**Impact:** The functions purpose is to return accidentally transfered funds but because of this bug the funds will be locked in the contract forever

    /// @notice (Admin) Withdraw Link or any ERC20 tokens accidentally sent here line 290

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

```diff
solidity
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-       if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
+       if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
