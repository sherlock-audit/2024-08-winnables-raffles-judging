# Raffles with exactly `minTicketsThreshold` tickets sold can still be cancelled

### Summary

Wrong conditional check/comparison in `minTicketsThreshold` will cause raffles with exactly `minTicketsThreshold` tickets to still be cancellable.

### Root Cause

In `checkShouldCancel()`:

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    // ...
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); // @audit if supply == minTicketsThreshold then still cancellable
}
```

Note that when the number of tickets sold is equal to `minTicketsThreshold` of the raffle, then the raffle is still cancellable. This is inconsistent with the code documentation about the use of `minTicketsThreshold`.

```solidity
/// @return minTicketsThreshold minimum number of tickets that needs to be sold before
///         this raffle is elligible for drawing a winner
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L75-L76

Furthermore, this is also inconsistent with `_checkShouldDraw()` for checking if a raffle should be drawable.

```solidity
function _checkShouldDraw(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    // ...
    if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached(); // @audit if target ticket is strictly less, then raffle is not drawable
}
```

One must also note that `cancelRaffle()` was designed to be callable by anyone (so as to prevent prize locking).

Therefore, when a raffle ends up with exactly `minTicketsThreshold`, anyone can still cancel the raffle and deny the potential winner their winnings, even if the raffle was supposed to be drawable.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The raffle needs to have had exactly `minTicketsThreshold` sold

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If a raffle ends up with exactly `minTicketsThreshold`, anyone can still cancel the raffle and deny the potential winner their winnings, even if the raffle was supposed to be drawable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The correct comparison should be `if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();`
