# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize`  function can cause drain of protocol funds.

## Description

The `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function in the smart contract allows winner to claim his prizes from a raffle. Depending on the raffle type, the function sends different prizes, such as NFTs, tokens, or ETH, to the caller. However, the function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it updates the contract's state after sending the prizes. The state update for the raffle prize is performed at the end of the function, which is too late to prevent a reentrancy attack. This timing allows a malicious actor to repeatedly call the `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract of its assets.

## Impact

A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize`  function repeatedly before the state variables (like `rafflePrize.status`) are updated, allowing them to drain the contract of its assets. This could result in significant financial loss, as the attacker could claim multiple prizes or the same prize multiple times, draining all available NFTs, tokens, or ETH held by the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent reentrancy attacks, it is recommended to follow these mitigation steps:

1. Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern: Ensure that all state changes (e.g., updating rafflePrize.status to CLAIMED) occur before any external calls (e.g., transferring NFTs, tokens, or ETH). This approach prevents reentrancy by ensuring that the contract's state is correctly updated before any external interactions are made.

```diff
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
+        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
-        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }

```

2.  Use Reentrancy Guard: Apply the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard contract to the  `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function to prevent any reentrant calls.

```diff
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external 
+ nonReentrant 
{
    ...
}
```
