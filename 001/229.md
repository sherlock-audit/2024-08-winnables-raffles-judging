# `WinnablesTicket` admin will set itself role `1` to mint tickets and steal prizes

### Summary

`WinnablesTicket::mint()` is called by role `1`, which is set to `WinnablesTicketManager`, so it can mint tickets when users call `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets()`. However, the admin of `WinnablesTicket` may set itself role `1` and mint as many tickets as it wants. This means the prizes can be claimed without paying ETH and the odds for legitimate users are decreased, breaking the [specification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-please-discuss-any-design-choices-you-made):
> Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicket`, the inherited [Roles::setRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L35-L37) may be called to set role `1` by the admin.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. In `WinnablesTicket::constructor()`, the admin role `0` is set to `msg.sender`. 
2. `WinnablesTicket` inherits `Roles`, which allows the admin to call `setRole(admin, 1, true)` and gain the role `1`.
3.  With this role, the admin can call `WinnableTickets::mint()` and claim any amount of tickets for itself, decreasing the odds for legitimate users and increasing its odds as much as it pleases.

### Impact

The admin increases its odds of claiming the prize and decreases other users' odds.

### PoC

`WinnablesTicket` does not override `Roles::setRole()`.

### Mitigation

`WinnablesTicket` must override `Roles::setRole()` and disable setting role `1`.
