# mint function may overflow causing the total number of existing tickets for a given Raffle ID to zero.

### Summary

The "unckecked" block in mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) function may overflow for _supplies[id], since there is no maximum supply restriction / limitation check for it.

For example, when startId is 120 , if the amount is 2^{256}-118 ï¼Œ then _supplies[id] = startId + amount will overflow causing _supplies[id] to become zero. this will be a disastrous result for this Raffle.

Even though this function can only be accessed by the admin, the odds can not be ruled out as this is a centralization risk.

The issue also applies to thhe operation " _balances[id][to] += amount".

### Root Cause

The " unchecked" block  allows arithmetic operations to be performed without overflow check and there is no limitation check for _supplies[id].

### Mitigation

import Openzepplin SafeMath Library (solidity version 0.8.0) for uint256 to mitigate overflow vulnerability.
