# The protocol doesn't properly check a cross-chain message receiver and chain selector

## Summary
The protocol doesn't properly check a cross-chain message receiver and chain selector

## Vulnerability Detail
WinnablesTicketManager.sol::`propagateRaffleWinner()` and `createRaffle()` are both public functions that are supposed to be called only once per raffle, because they change a raffle's status and revert if invoked again for the same raffle. These functions send a cross-chain message, but they don't properly sanitize the `address prizeManager`, `uint64 chainSelector` arguments. Because of that, a malicious user could actually invoke the functions with an arbitrary address/chain selector and the cross-chain message won't be received on the protocol address but on the malicious user's. Since the raffle status has been changed, there's no way to call these functions again, so the Ethereum contract won't ever receive the message from the Avalanche contract.
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
```solidity
function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```
```solidity
function _sendCCIPMessage(
        address ccipDestAddress,
        uint64 ccipDestChainSelector,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
        if (ccipDestAddress == address(0) || ccipDestChainSelector == uint64(0)) { // not a proper check
            revert MissingCCIPParams();
        }

```
## Impact
A malicious user can prevent the receiving of messages from Avalanche contract to Ethereum contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a proper check on the specified address and chain selector or hardcode those values.
