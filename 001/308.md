# Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in `claimPrize` Function When Handling ETH Prizes

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in the WinnablesPrizeManager contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack when dealing with ETH prizes. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to claim an ETH prize multiple times, potentially draining the contract of more ETH than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `raffleType == RaffleType.ETH`, the `claimPrize` function calls `_sendETHPrize`, which uses a low-level `call` to transfer ETH to the winner. This external call occurs before the `rafflePrize.status` is updated to `CLAIMED`. As a result, a malicious contract could re-enter the `claimPrize` function and trigger it again, claiming the prize multiple times before the state is updated.


## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
1. Claim the same ETH prize multiple times.
2. Drain the contract of more ETH than they are entitled to.
3. Potentially empty the contract of all its ETH if the prize amount is significant.

This could lead to substantial financial losses for the protocol and other legitimate winners.

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        // ... NFT logic ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        // ... Token logic ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
        _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the following changes:

1. Reorder the function to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:
   - Perform all checks first (winner validity, claim status).
   - Update the contract state (set status to CLAIMED, update `_ethLocked`).
   - Perform the ETH transfer last.

2. Consider using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` for additional protection.

Here's an example of how the function could be restructured:

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external nonReentrant {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;

    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        // ... NFT logic ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        // ... Token logic ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        uint256 amount = _ethRaffles[raffleId];
        unchecked { _ethLocked -= amount; }
        _sendETHPrize(amount, msg.sender);
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();

    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```
