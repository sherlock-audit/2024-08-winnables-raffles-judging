# Attacker Can Pass A ChainSelector Of His Choice Breaking The Core Mechanism

## Summary

Attacker can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` with a chainSelector of his choice ( a valid chainSelector provided but of a chain that winnable don't support ,  then the message will be sent to that chain) and grief the actual winner , the winner would never receive the prize.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Assume the raffle is completed and the random number has been decided and set  ,

2.) Now anyone can call `propagateRaffleWinner()`  , our attacker calls this and provides an incorrect `chainSelector`

3.) The reason for providing an incorrect chainSelector is that the message would be sent to the prizeManager contract but on a different chain , meaning the actual prize manager of winnable would never receive this message.

4.) Now this message has been sent to a completely different chain and the function `_sendCCIPMessage` does not verify if it's the correct chainSelector  , the Raffle status is set to propagated ->

The actual "winner" was not assigned in the prize manager contract due to this .

5.) Therefore , now `propagateRaffleWinner` cannot be called again for this raffle (L336), meaning the actual winner will never be assigned for this raffle in the prize manager.

6.) Winner has lost his rewards.

## Impact

Attacker can call the propagateRaffleWinner with a chainSelector of his choice and grief the actual winner , the winner would never receive the prize. The prizes would be locked forever in the ticket manager.

## Recommendation

Verify the correct chainSelector has been passed.
