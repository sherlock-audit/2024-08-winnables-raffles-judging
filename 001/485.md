# `WinnablesTicketManager.withdrawTokens()` can be denied by sending a single wei of the token being withdrawn

### Summary

`WinnablesTicketManager.withdrawTokens()` has a wrong < and > check, allowing anyone to deny a call to `withdrawTokens()` by sending a single wei of the token.

### Root Cause

We examine the function `withdrawTokens`:

```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); // @audit should be >
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

The `if (amount < balance)` condition prevents withdrawing any amount that is strictly below the contract's balance.

While the admin can still withdraw the full balance of the tokens, anyone can deny the withdraw by front-running and sending one wei of the token into the contract, causing the if to evaluate to true and reverting.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.  Admin intends to withdraw LINK, and calls `withdrawTokens()`. The contract currently has 10 LINK, and the admin intends to withdraw all of them.
2. Adversary sends one wei of LINK into the contract.
3. Admin's withdrawal fails due to the aforementioned wrong condition check.

### Impact

Adversary can block ERC20 withdrawals by sending a single wei into the contract

### PoC

### Mitigation

The condition should be `if (amount > balance)`
