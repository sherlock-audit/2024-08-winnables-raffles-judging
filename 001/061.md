# Less than contract token balance can not be withdrawn from WinnablesTicketManager

## Summary

Faulty check in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract prevents admin from withdrawing less than the token balance of the contract from the contract itself.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a wrongly written if statement in `withdrawTokens` that prevents the `amount` argument to be less than the token balance of the contract.

## Impact

One scenario that would cause inconvenience is that the admin would want to withdraw `LINK` tokens from the contract. This breaks the contest assumption of always keeping enough `LINK` on the contract to pay for cross-chain call fees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change snippet to:
```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); //@audit
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
