# Incorrect Raffle Ticket Threshold Logic Allows Simultaneous Cancellation and Drawing

## Summary

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract contains a vulnerability where the raffle logic incorrectly handles cases where the number of tickets sold is equal to the `minTicketsThreshold`. This leads to a situation where a raffle can be both cancellable and drawable at the same time, which is not the intended behavior. Specifically, if the number of tickets sold equals the `minTicketsThreshold`, the raffle should be drawable and not cancellable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract defines `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` as the minimum number of tickets that must be sold before a raffle can draw a winner. Two internal functions handle the drawing and cancellation conditions:

1. **`_checkShouldDraw`:**
   ```solidity
   if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
   ```
   This function checks if the raffle has reached the required number of tickets to be drawable.

2. **`_checkShouldCancel`:**
   ```solidity
   if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
   ```
   This function checks if the raffle can be canceled if the ticket supply is below the threshold.

The issue is that when `supply` equals `minTicketsThreshold`, the checks pass in both functions, causing the raffle to be both cancellable and drawable. However, if the `minTicketsThreshold` is met, the raffle should not be canceled and should instead be drawn.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
```javascript
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');
const { expect } = require('chai');
const helpers = require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers');

const {
  getWalletWithEthers, blockTime, timeSeconds,
} = require('./common/utils');
const { ccipDeployTicketManager } = require('../utils/demo');
const { randomWord } = require('./common/chainlink');
const { whileImpersonating } = require('../utils/impersonate');
const { BigNumber } = require('ethers');

ethers.utils.Logger.setLogLevel(ethers.utils.Logger.levels.ERROR);

      await (await link.mint(manager.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'))).wait();
      await (await manager.setCCIPCounterpart(counterpartContractAddress, 1, true)).wait();
      await whileImpersonating(ccipRouter.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>

          data: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001',

        })
      );
      const now = await blockTime();
      await manager.createRaffle(
        1,
        now,
        now + timeSeconds.hour,
        200,
        1000,
        100
      );
      for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        const buyer = await getWalletWithEthers();
        const currentBlock = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
        const sig = await api.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(
          ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint16', 'uint256', 'uint256'], [
            buyer.address,
            0,
            1,
            100,
            currentBlock + 10,
            100
          ])));
        await (await manager.connect(buyer).buyTickets(1, 100, currentBlock + 10, sig, { value: 100 })).wait();
        buyers.push(buyer);
        const { totalSpent, totalPurchased, withdrawn } = await manager.getParticipation(1, buyer.address);
        expect(totalSpent).to.eq(100);
        expect(totalPurchased).to.eq(100);
        expect(withdrawn).to.eq(false);
      }
      await helpers.time.increase(3601);
      const shouldCancel = await manager.shouldCancelRaffle(1);
      const shouldDraw = await manager.shouldDrawRaffle(1);
      // when minTicketsThreshold filled, it shouldn't canceled, due to lack of logic now it could cancel and draw at the same time
      expect(shouldCancel).to.eq(shouldDraw);
      await manager.cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1);
    });
  });
});
```

In this test, when the `minTicketsThreshold` is filled, both cancellation and drawing are allowed due to the flawed logic.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows a raffle to be closed when it should be drwan, the impact is on users and admin as they locked their prize or eth and wait untill end of raffle, at end instead of drawing it could canceled.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `_checkShouldCancel` function to account for cases where the ticket supply is equal to `minTicketsThreshold`. This prevents simultaneous cancellation and drawing:

```diff
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
-    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
+    if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```
