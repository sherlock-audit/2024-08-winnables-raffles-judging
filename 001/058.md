# Odds manipulation violates raffle fairness principles

## Summary

The admin can manipulate the odds by purchasing a large number of tickets for themselves, which violates the principle below:

> The principles that must always remain true are:
> - Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

## Vulnerability Detail

The winner is determined based on [a random number generated from the total number of sold tickets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L474-L475). The admin has the ability to purchase a significant number of tickets just before the raffle ends. By doing so, they can inflate the total number of tickets, effectively diluting the odds for other participants. 

Once the raffle concludes, the admin can [withdraw all locked ETH from the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300), meaning the only cost incurred by the admin for this manipulation is the gas fee required to buy the tickets.

## Impact

The principle "Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle" can be broken.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Document that the admin can be trusted.

Another potential solution is to increase the number of winner rewards proportional to the number of tickets sold.
