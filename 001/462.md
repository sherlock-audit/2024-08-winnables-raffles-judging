# Malicious admin can withdraw a reward he staked, even if a raffle is not cancaled

### Summary

In the readme of the contest it is explicitly stated that admins are not fully trusted: *Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize*. However this invariant can be easily broken by a malicious admin. Admins should always provide some quantity of LINK tokens in the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract, as LINK is required for sending CCIP messages. However LINK can also be locked as a reward for a raffle via the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) function. Keep in mind that the LINK token is fully compliant with the ERC20 standard but has some additional functionality, which has nothing to do with the vulnerability described in this report. As per the updated readme *We are supposed to support all 100% valid ERC20 tokens + USDC and USDT.* When the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) function is called:
```solidity
    function lockTokens(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (tokenBalance < amount + _tokensLocked[token]) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.TOKEN;
        unchecked { _tokensLocked[token] += amount; }
        _tokenRaffles[raffleId].tokenAddress = token;
        _tokenRaffles[raffleId].amount = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit TokenPrizeLocked(raffleId, token, amount);
    }
```
the **_tokensLocked[token]  mapping** is increased with the rewards for the raffle, as can be seen from the code snippet above. 
However in the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function there is a subtraction in an unchecked block:
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 availableBalance;
        unchecked { availableBalance = tokenBalance - _tokensLocked[token]; }
        if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
Consider the following scenario. If the admin has deposited some LINK tokens in the contract, so CCIP messages can be send, and then creates a raffle where the reward is in LINK tokens for example **10_000e18** LINK tokens, he can first withdraw all the link he has sent in the contract for fees via the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function, then start another raffle so the total balance of LINK in the contract drops below the ***_tokensLocked[token]** for the LINK token and an underflow can occur. Then when the admin calls the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function again, lets say there is **9_999e18** LINK tokens left in the contract, he can freely withdraw **9_998e18** LINK tokens. Thus when the winner of the raffle is propagated from the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract, and tries to call the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function in order to claim his reward, he won't be able to as the admin will already have withdrawn the LINK tokens, and the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function will revert. When a winner is successfully propagated, the admin can withdraw the proceeds from tickets that the users bought in the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract, thus effectively breaking core invariant of the protocol and stealing money from the users of the protocol. 


### Root Cause

There is a subtraction in an unchecked block in the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin deposits LINK tokens to the ``WinnablesManager.sol`` contract in order to pay for the CCIP messages.
2. Admin creates a raffle via the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) function where the reward is in LINK tokens.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Admin deposits **1e18** LINK tokens to the ``WinnablesManager.sol`` contract in order to pay for the CCIP messages plus additional **10_000e18** LINK tokens to use for a raffle reward.
2. Admin creates a raffle with ID 1 via the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) function where the reward is in LINK tokens, the reward is **10_000e18** LINK tokens.
3. The malicious admin first calls the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function in order to withdraw the **1e18** LINK he deposited for fees, considering that when the admin called the [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) function a CCIP message was sent, for which the fee was paid in LINK tokens the balance of LINK tokens in the contract will be less than **10_000e18** LINK tokens. For simplicity lets say that currently the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract holds **9_999e18** LINK tokens.
4. The admin can call the  [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function again and withdraw **9_998e18** LINK tokens, effectively stealing the rewards from the winner of the raffle. 
5. Once a winner is drawn and propagated to the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract, the admin will be able to withdraw all of the proceeds from the bought tickets in the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract. 

### Impact

A malicious admin can withdraw the reward for a raffle, if the reward is in LINK tokens because of an underflow in the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function, breaking a core vulnerability of the protocol and effectively stealing rewards from the potential winner of the raffle, thus the high severity.

### Mitigation

Remove the unchecked block in the [withdrawToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218-L224) function, just subtract the values so the function reverts if an underflow occurs.
