# Admin won't be able to withdraw ETH after a raffle cancellation

### Summary

Not updating the `_lockedEth` in refundPlayers function will cause the admin to not be able to withdraw eth(raised from raffles) ever after. 

### Root Cause

In refundPlayers, the `_lockedEth` variable is not decremented(`WinnablesTicketManager.sol:215`), and thus leads to `withdrawEth` function to always revert. (`WinnablesTicketManager.sol:300`).

### Internal pre-conditions

At least 1 raffle must have been cancelled.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Assume a raffle has been created and it raises 100ETH. (this makes `_lockedEth = 100ETH`) (balance of the contract = 100ETH).
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182-L210)
```solidity
unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
}
```
2. This raffle is cancelled and all the players refund their paid amount. (since refundPlayers doesn't decrement _lockedEth, `lockedEth = 100ETH`) (balance of the contract = 0ETH).
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215-L228)

3. Another raffle is created and it raises 50ETH. (this makes `_lockedEth = 150ETH`) (balance of the contract = 50ETH).
4. This raffle gets completed and the _lockedEth is updated in the propagateRaffleWinner function. (this makes `_lockedEth = 150 - 50ETH = 100ETH) (balance of the contract = 50ETH).
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334-L345)
```solidity
unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
```
5. Admin tries to withdraw the raised eth (50ETH raised in the recent raffle) by calling the withdrawEth function.

6. In the withdrawEth function, balance = balance of contract - _lockedETH   => balance = 50 - 150 ETH. Since this is in the unchecked block of the function, the result will be a large number thus causing the `_sendEth` function to revert.
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300-L306)
```solidity
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
}
```
          


### Impact

This would mean that once a raffle is cancelled, the `_lockedEth` will always be greater than balance of the contract. And the admin will never be able to claim the eth raised by future raffles. Thus, leading to 100% loss of funds for future raffles.

### Mitigation

A way to mitigate this issue is to decrement the _lockedEth when a refund is done.
```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
            _lockedEth -= amountToSend; // updating the lockedEth
        }
}
```
