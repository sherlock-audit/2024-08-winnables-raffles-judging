# DOS of the create raffle functionality

## Summary
When a prize is locked on Mainnet, there is an CCIP message sent to the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol `on Avalance. This message allows a raffle to be created. However an attacker can cancel the raffle even before started every time, meaning a constant DOS of the create functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
- The winnables admin locks a prize on Mainnet
- An attacker monitors the txs on Avalance and sees that WinnablesTicketManager has received an event that the prize is locked
- The raffle status becomes PRIZE_LOCKED: 
```solidity
    function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();// message.data is bytes
        (uint256 raffleId) = abi.decode(message.data, (uint256));//ok, decoding works. encoded with: abi.encodePacked(raffleId) type uint256, 
        if (_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE) {// existing raffle, cannot be created, mistake by the prizeManager
        // The raffle cannot be created, send back a cancel message to unlock the prize
            _sendCCIPMessage(
                _senderAddress,
                message.sourceChainSelector,
                abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
            );
            return;
        }
        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;

        emit RafflePrizeLocked(
            message.messageId,
            message.sourceChainSelector,
            raffleId
        );
    }
```
- Immediately after this tx, the attacker calls WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle()
- The raffle is canceled, this happens each time the winnables team tries to lock prizes and create raffles: raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;


This attack is possible because the logic for validating if a raffle could be canceled checks for  PRIZE_LOCKED status

```solidity
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
      ...
    }
```


## Impact
DOS of create raffle functionality, loss of LINK tokens for the winnables protocol for CCIP messaging, reputation loss

## Recommendation
Consider only admin roles to have the ability to cancel raffles
