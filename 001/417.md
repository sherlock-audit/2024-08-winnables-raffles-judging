# Attacker will prevent refunds to multiple players by front-running the `refundPlayers` function with a single player already refunded

### Summary

Lack of access control on the `refundPlayers` function will cause griefing for the protocol as an attacker can front-run legitimate refund operations by including a player who has already been refunded, triggering a `PlayerAlreadyRefunded` error and forcing the user or admin to rerun the function.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:215](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215), the `refundPlayers` function lacks access control, allowing anyone to call it with arbitrary player lists, potentially including players who have already been refunded.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker monitors the blockchain and sees that the user is about to call the `refundPlayers` function with a list of players.
2. The attacker front-runs the transaction by calling `refundPlayers` with the player who is first in the user's list.
3. The attacker's transaction is executed first, marking the first player in the list as refunded.
4. When the user's transaction is executed, it fails immediately because the first player in the list has already been marked as refunded by the attacker, triggering a `PlayerAlreadyRefunded` error.
5. The user is forced to identify the refunded player, remove them from the list, and rerun the function with the remaining players.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from increased gas costs as the user must rerun the refundPlayers function after removing the already-refunded player from the list.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control on the refundPlayers function to ensure that only authorized roles (such as the admin) can call it.
