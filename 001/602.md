# Winner prize can be sent to the wrong address on destination chain when account abstraction wallets are used

## Summary
Users with account abstraction wallets have different addresses across different chains for the same account, so if someone using an account abstraction wallet participates in a raffle, and wins, the prize will be sent to the address on the destination chain which may not belong to the winner.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user buys the tickets using the `buyTickets` function, it is the msg.sender who gets minted the ticket tokens. If it's an AA wallet, it gets minted the raffle tickets:

```solidity
    function buyTickets(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
        _checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);

        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[msg.sender]);
        uint128 totalPaid = uint128(participation) + uint128(msg.value);
        uint32 totalPurchased = uint32(participation >> 128) + uint32(ticketCount);
        unchecked {
            raffle.participations[msg.sender] = bytes32(
                (participation & type(uint256).max << 160)
                | totalPaid |
                uint256(totalPurchased) << 128
            );
        }
        unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).mint(msg.sender, raffleId, ticketCount);
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

If this AA wallet was the winner of the raffle, the address it registered on the source chain gets sent to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract on the destination chain using the `propagateRaffleWinner` function:

```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

So, on the source chain, this address is registered as the winner. But, the problem is on the source chain the same address may not belong to the same AA wallet. Hence, the AA wallet will not be able to claim the prize.

## Impact
AA wallets cannot claim prizes when they are the winner of a raffle, breaking a core functionality of the protocol.

## Recommendation
Allow users to specify the address for which they want to receive prizes on the destination chain.
