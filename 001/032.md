# Not updating `_lockedETH` in the `refundPlayers()` function leads to the asset being locked

## Summary

The [WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215) function does not update the `_lockedETH` variable to reflect refunded assets. This prevents the contract's admin from fully withdrawing available assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_lockedETH` variable is intended to [track the amount of ETH locked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L206) in the contract from ticket sales for raffles. When a raffle is canceled, the `refundPlayers()` function is designed to return the ETH paid by users. However, the refunded ETH is not subtracted from `_lockedETH`. As a result, `_lockedETH` continues to include the amount of ETH that has already been refunded to users. This causes the [withdrawETH()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300) function to undercalculate the amount of ETH that can be withdrawn by the admin.

## Impact

The admin is unable to withdraw the full balance of available ETH. The assets equivalent to the refunded amount remain locked in the contract.
