# an attacker can prevent the winner of getting the prize

## Summary
After a successful raffle, a winner is chosen by calling `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()`. After that Chainlink VRF provides the random number for the choice of the winner. After that anyone can call `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` and mark the prize as claimable, so the winner can go on Ethereum Mainnet and claim it. However the propagation proccess is flawed and the CCIP message might not reach the WinnablesPrizeManager contract which is deployed on Mainnet. This will result in prize funds being locked forever inside the WinnablesPrizeManager contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
- Alice deploys a malicious CCIP receiver on Mainnet which can consume the messages sent from the Avalance deployed contract(WinnablesTicketManager.sol)
- Bob is selected for the winner of a raffle
- Alice(malicious user) calls `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` with args prizeManager= her own address on Mainnet, different than WinnablesPrizeManager.sol
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

// @audit-issue attacker can make the actual winner not receive it's funds by calling propagateRaffleWinner() with diff args than the Winnables contracts on mainnet
        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
- Alice receives the message on Mainnet, however the Winnables contract does not
- As a result the raffle status becomes RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED, and the prize cannot be propagated again to the Winnables contract
- Bob cannot claim his prize from WinnablesPrizeManager
- Winnables admins cannot rescue the locked prize, because locked prizes cannot be withdrawn by the admins


## Impact
The winner cannot claim his prize. Also the prize remains stuck on Mainnet and cannot be rescued by the winnables admins

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector from the params of propagateRaffleWinner(). Instead hardcode them, or make them configurable only by the admins
