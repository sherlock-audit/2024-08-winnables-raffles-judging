# Incorrect Balance Check in Token Withdrawal Function Leads to Denial of Service

# Summary

The `withdrawTokens` function in the WinnablesTicketManager contract contains a critical logic error in its balance check. This error prevents the withdrawal of any amount less than the full balance of a given token, effectively rendering the function unusable for partial withdrawals and potentially locking funds in the contract.

# Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is located in the [`withdrawTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L295-L296) function of the WinnablesTicketManager contract. The function is designed to allow administrators to withdraw ERC20 tokens that may have been accidentally sent to the contract. However, the balance check is implemented incorrectly. 
The issue lies in the condition `if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();`. This condition will revert the transaction if the requested withdrawal amount is less than the total balance, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

# Impact

- Denial of Service: The function will revert for any withdrawal attempt that is not for the exact full balance of the token in the contract. This effectively renders the function unusable for partial withdrawals.
- Potential Fund Lock: If the contract receives multiple deposits of the same token over time, it becomes impossible to withdraw these funds separately. The admin would be forced to withdraw the entire balance at once, which may not always be desirable or practical.
- Increased Risk of Errors: If an admin attempts to withdraw the full balance but slightly miscalculates the amount, the transaction will fail, potentially leading to confusion and repeated attempts.
- Reduced Flexibility: The inability to perform partial withdrawals significantly reduces the contract's flexibility in managing funds, which could be particularly problematic in emergency situations or when precise fund management is required.

Manual Review

# Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the balance check should be reversed. Here's the corrected code:

```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); // Corrected check
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
