# A malicious winner can drain `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract funds by exploiting the `claimPrize` function

### Summary

The lack of a proper reentrancy guard or CEI pattern in the `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function will cause a complete drain of contract funds for the Winnables protocol as a malicious raffle winner repeatedly calls the function to claim ETH prizes before the state is updated.

### Root Cause

In [`WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:105`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124), `rafflePrize.status` variable is updated only after the funds have been transferred to the winner. In the case of an ETH-based raffle, the contract uses `call` to transfer funds to the winnerâ€™s address, which allows an attacker to exploit this by calling back into the `claimPrize` function and claiming the prize multiple times. This could enable the attacker to drain all the ETH in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A malicious user wins a raffle.
2. It is ETH-based raffle.

### External pre-conditions

A malicious user deploys a contract that can join the raffles and perform reentrant calls.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user deploys a smart contract that can interact with `WinnablesTicketManager` contract and perform reentrant calls.
2. The attacker wins an ETH-based raffle.
3. The attacker invokes `claimPrize` from their malicious contract.
4. The `claimPrize` function sends ETH to the attacker's contract address via `call` before updating the `RafflePrizeStatus` to `CLAIMED`.
5. The malicious contract recursively calls `claimPrize` again from `receive` before the state is updated.
6. Steps 4 and 5 repeat, draining the ETH from the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract until depletion.

### Impact

The Winnables protocol suffers a complete loss of all ETH held in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. The malicious actor gains all the ETH in the contract, while other legitimate winners are unable to claim their prizes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add these lines of code in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize`:
```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
++       if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
++       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED)
++            revert AlreadyClaimed();
++        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked {
                _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount;
            }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked {
                _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId];
            }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
--       if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
--       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED)
--            revert AlreadyClaimed();
--        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
