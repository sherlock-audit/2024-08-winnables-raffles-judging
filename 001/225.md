# An attacker will lock prizes indefinitely in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract and restrict winner from claiming their prizes

### Summary

An attacker can pass an arbitrary `prizeManager` address to `propagateRaffleWinner()` or `cancelRaffle()` will cause a permenent prize lock  in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. This is because the attacker can use their own contract as the `prizeManager` to bypass the CCIP message, As a result, the raffle status may be incorrectly updated, leading to the prize being locked indefinitely in the  `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.



### Root Cause

**cancelRaffle()**

In [`WinnablesTicketManager.sol:278`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278C35-L278C47) The `prizeManager` is used as user input and there is no validation to make sure that the input is the correct prize manager.

If an attacker exploits this vulnerability in `cancelRaffle()`, they can update the raffle status to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED` in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. However, the raffle will not be canceled in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract, leading to inconsistent states and cuase the locked prize non retrievable.

**propagateRaffleWinner()**

In [`WinnablesTicketManager:334`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334C44-L334C56) The `prizeManager` is used as user input and there is no validation to make sure that the input is the correct prize manager.

An attacker can pass an arbitrary `prizeManager` address. This results in the raffle status being updated to `RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED` and a message being sent to an incorrect destination. Consequently, the correct winner cannot be sent to the prize manager, effectively locking the prize in the `prizeManager` contract forever. That means this vulnerability make the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract to unable to identify and distribute the prize to winner.

### Internal pre-conditions

**cancelRaffle()**
1. Admin should lock prize in `WinnablesPrizeManager` 
2. Raffle should be in cancellable state

**propagateRaffleWinner()**
1. Admin should lock prize in `WinnablesPrizeManager` 
2. Raffle status should be `FULFILLED`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

**cancelRaffle()**
1. Attacker deploys a dummy prize manager contract which will accept any CCIP message
2. Attacker calls `cancelRaffle()` with dummy `prizeManager` address and a cancellable `raffleId`
3. `_raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED` get updated and CCIP message send to dummy contract
4. So, the above status update effectively prevent anyone from cancelling the raffle correcly

```solidity
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
```

**propagateRaffleWinner()**
1. Attacker deploys a dummy prize manager contract which will accept any CCIP message
2. Attacker calls `propagateRaffleWinner()` with dummy `prizeManager` address and a FULFILLED `raffleId`
3. `raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED` get updated and  CCIP message send to dummy contract
5. So, the above status update effectively prevent anyone from propagte the winner correctly 

```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
```

### Impact

- Prizes may be locked indefinitely in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.
- Eligible winners will be unable to claim their prizes from the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.
- The protocol will be unable to cancel or unlock prizes for cancellable raffles.

### Mitigation

Consider setting `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` globally and use it in the `cancelRaffle()` and `propagateRaffleWinner()` functions

```diff
+    address prizeManager;
+    uint64 chainSelector;
     function setCCIPCounterpart(
         address contractAddress,
         uint64 chainSelector,
         bool enabled
     ) external onlyRole(0) {
         _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
+        prizeManager = contractAddress;
+        chainSelector = chainSelector;
     }
```

```diff
-    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
+    function cancelRaffle(uint256 raffleId) external {
         _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);
 
         _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
```

```diff
-    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
+    function propagateRaffleWinner(uint256 raffleId) external {
         Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
         if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
         raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
```
