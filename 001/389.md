# H-1: Locked ETH is not updated upon players refund, resulting in permanent stuck funds

## Summary

Raffles that fail to meet the minimum ticket threshold can be cancelled, and users are refunded. However, incorrect accounting of locked ETH after refunds results in permanently stuck funds within the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail

`refundPlayers()` function is expected to distribute back the price players have paid to participate in already cancelled raffle.

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```

The `_lockedETH` state variable tracks the ETH received from players purchasing tickets and is reduced when a raffle is won. Its purpose is to determine how much ETH the Admin can withdraw from the contract, ensuring that only ETH from completed raffles is withdrawable.

```solidity
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }

```

In the current implementation, the `refundPlayers()` function does not update the `_lockedFunds` variable after refunding players, resulting in an inconsistent contract state.
`_lockedFunds` will always increase and will not be consistent with the actual balance of the contract.

The withdrawal amount is calculated using the expression `unchecked {balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;}`. If the `_lockedETH` exceeds the contract's current balance (which will happen after the first refund) this subtraction will cause an underflow, leading to `balance` being set to a very large number. As a result, the contract will attempt to transfer more ETH than it actually holds, which will cause the transaction to fail and prevent any withdrawals. This way all ticket fees funds will be forever stuck in the contract.

## Impact

Permanent stuck funds.

## Recommendation

Consider substracting the `_lockedEth` variable in `refundPlayers()` function:

```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
+           _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
