# Wrong Validation Check on `withdrawTokens` Function in WinnablesTicketManager.sol

## Summary
The `withdrawTokens` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract contains a logical error in the condition that checks whether the contract has a sufficient balance to fulfill a withdrawal request. This issue can prevent valid withdrawals and allow invalid ones, potentially leading to an underflow or improper handling of token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdrawTokens` function, the condition used to check if the contract has enough tokens to fulfill the withdrawal request is incorrect. The current condition is:

```solidity
if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```
This condition incorrectly reverts the transaction when the requested `amount` is less than the `balance`, which should not be a reason for reverting. The correct logic should be to revert if the requested `amount` is greater than the available `balance`. The correct condition should be:

```solidity
if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```
This issue may cause valid withdrawal requests (where `amount < balance`) to fail and invalid requests (where `amount > balance`) to succeed, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Impact
The impact of this issue can be severe as it may:

 - **Prevent Valid Withdrawals**: Users or authorized roles may be unable to withdraw tokens even when the contract has a sufficient balance.
 - **Allow Invalid Withdrawals**: It could potentially allow withdrawals of more tokens than are actually available, which might lead to unexpected token transfers, underflow issues, or incorrect token accounting.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code is as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L292

```solidity
function withdrawTokens(
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyRole(0) {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); // Vulnerability is here
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix the issue, update the condition in the `withdrawTokens` function as follows:

```diff
function withdrawTokens(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
         IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
         uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
+        if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
         token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }
```
