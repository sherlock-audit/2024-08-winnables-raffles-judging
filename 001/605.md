# H-2: Admin can prevent winners from withdrawing his prize

## Summary

The README of the contest clearly states that "Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize." However, in the current implementation, this invariant can be violated. The admin has the ability to prevent winners from withdrawing their prize, which contradicts the intended design and could undermine the fairness of the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail

The issue stems from the ability of admin to override CCIP counterpart before `propagateRaffleWinner()` is called

```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

Initially, the admin can set the CCIP counterpart correctly, for example, by linking the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract on the Ethereum mainnet:
```solidity
ticketManager.setCCIPCounterpart(address(prizeManager), 5009297550715157269, true); Â  
```

However, the admin can later override the `enabled` status of this counterpart:
```solidity
ticketManager.setCCIPCounterpart(address(prizeManager), 5009297550715157269, false);
```

This would prevent the contracts from communicating with each other, effectively locking the winner's funds and disrupting the entire functionality of the system.
## Impact

Admin can prevent winner from withdrawing his prize and DoS of the whole system.

## Recommendation

Consider removing the possibility to disable a counterpart or implement additional logic for special cases where disabling should be supported
