# All ethers from the WinnablePrizeManager contract can be drained

## Summary
All funds from the `WinnablePrizeManager` contract can be drained through a reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user is picked as a winner, he can call the `claimPrize` function to receive his reward from the raffle. If the raffle is of type ETH, the ETHs are sent directly to the `msg.sender`.

`_sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);`

```solidity
function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
        //@note winner = msg.sender
        (bool success, ) = winner.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
```

After the ethers are sent, the status of the raffle prize is marked as `CLAIMED`, but a malicious user can exploit the contract by using a reentrancy attack to drain all ethers from the contract by repeatedly calling the `claimPrize` function until all ETHs are drained.

The `check-effects-interactions` practice is not well implemented because if the user is a smart contract, he can make multiple calls to the function again because the status is updated at the end of the function.

## Impact
All ethers from the `WinnablePrizeManager` contract can be drained.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following changes:

```diff
   function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;

+       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
+        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;

        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
-        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
-        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
