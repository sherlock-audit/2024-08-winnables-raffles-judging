# WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::claimPrize() is open to reentrancy and also has incorrect access control

## Summary
claimPrize() in WinnablesPrizeManager.sol is vulnerable to reentrancy and has wrong access control
## Vulnerability Detail
claimPrize() is defined as:
```solidity
 /// @notice (Public) Send the prize for a Raffle to its rightful winner
    /// @param raffleId ID of the raffle
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();//@audit-issue the check is placed incorrectly
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;//@audit-issue that will not prevent reentrancy
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
The function handles distributing the rewards for the winner based on the raffle type. There are 2 issues with the current implementation. The first one is the following line:
```solidity
   if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
```
The access control is placed after transferring the reward, which means any other user who is not winner can claim the reward.
**An example scenario:**
Bob, who is not the legitimate winner, creates a contract and calls claimPrize.  ETH is sent to him via _sendETHPrize. The ETH is sent, triggering Bob's fallback function, which calls `claimPrize` again. When the check in the claimPrize function is  finally performed, it realizes Bob isn't the winner and reverts, but by this point, the funds has already been sent, and the contract could be in a compromised state. 

The second issue is that `  rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;` is set after transfering the reward, which is an open door to reentrancy. The winner can reenter the function and claim the rewards multiple times, until the contract has no funds.

NOTE: The issue is mentioned in previous [audit](https://github.com/Winnables/public-contracts/blob/main/audits/2024-08-05-Peckshield-Audit-Report.pdf) and it seems there has been a fix, however in the current repo , the code in the claimPrize() contradicts with that. 

## Impact
Draining the funds of contract, the rightfull winner can lose the funds he deserved

## Tool used
Manual Review, Vs Code
## Recommendation
Move the access control check to the beginning and set the claimed status before transfering the funds.
```solidity
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];

++    // Early access control check
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();

       // Update the state before any external calls
++    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;

        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
       
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
