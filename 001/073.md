# Lack of parameter validation in `propagateRaffleWinner` Leads to failed prize claims on mainnet

## Summary
The `propagateRaffleWinner` function can be exploited by providing incorrect `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` parameters, leading to a situation where the raffle is marked as propagated, but the winner is unable to claim their prize on the mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail
After a raffle is drawn and a winner is determined via Chainlink VRF, anyone can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` function to propagate the winner's information to the mainnet, allowing the winner to claim their prize:
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
    raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
    address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

>>>    _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
    IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    unchecked {
        _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
    }
}

function _sendCCIPMessage(
        address ccipDestAddress,
        uint64 ccipDestChainSelector,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
        if (ccipDestAddress == address(0) || ccipDestChainSelector == uint64(0)) { // @audit Only basic checks
            revert MissingCCIPParams();
        }

        // Send CCIP message to the desitnation contract
        IRouterClient router = IRouterClient(CCIP_ROUTER);
        LinkTokenInterface linkToken = LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN);

        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
            receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
            data: data,
            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
            extraArgs: "",
            feeToken: LINK_TOKEN
        });

    uint256 fee = router.getFee(
        ccipDestChainSelector,
        message
    );
    uint256 currentLinkBalance = linkToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    if (fee > currentLinkBalance) {
        revert InsufficientLinkBalance(currentLinkBalance, fee);
    }

    messageId = router.ccipSend(
        ccipDestChainSelector,
        message
    );
}
```
As seen above, the raffle status is set to `PROPAGATED` and `_lockedETH` is decremented immediately after the function is called. However, the function does not perform adequate checks on the `prizeManager` address or the `chainSelector`. As a result, a malicious user could provide an unsupported chain or an incorrect `prizeManager` address. This would result in the transaction being marked as successful on the source chain (with the raffle status set to `PROPAGATED` and `_lockedETH` decremented), but the Prize Manager contract on the mainnet would not be notified about the raffle's winner. Consequently, the winner would be unable to claim their prize on the mainnet.
## Impact
A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by calling `propagateRaffleWinner` with incorrect `prizeManager` or `chainSelector` values, causing the raffle to be incorrectly marked as propagated on Avalanche, while the winner would be unable to claim their prize on the mainnet.

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the `propagateRaffleWinner` function to be callable only by an admin, or implement additional checks to validate the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` parameters.
