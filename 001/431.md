# Unupdated _lockedETH in refundPlayers Function Leads to Potential Fund Locking

### Summary

_lockedETH Inconsistency in refundPlayers Function
[gh_link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215)
The missing update of `_lockedETH` in the `refundPlayers` function will cause potential fund locking for the contract owner (unintentionally) or a malicious user will lock the contract's ETH balance through repeated raffle cancellations and refunds, leaving `_lockedETH` artificially high. 



### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:refundPlayers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215) the _lockedETH state variable is not decreased when refunds are processed, leading to an inconsistency between the actual locked ETH and the tracked amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract needs to have multiple raffles created with significant ETH locked.

2. At least one raffle needs to be in a state where it can be canceled.

3. The `_lockedETH` value needs to be close to the total contract balance.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The contract starts with a certain amount of ETH balance.
   - `_lockedETH` accurately represents the amount of ETH locked in active raffles.

2. **Ticket Purchase**:
   - When users buy tickets using the `buyTickets` function, `_lockedETH` is increased:
     ```solidity
     unchecked {
         raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
         _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
         _lockedETH += msg.value;
     }
     ```

3. **Raffle Cancellation**:
   - An attacker or admin cancels a raffle using the `cancelRaffle` function.
   - This changes the raffle status to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED`.

4. **Refund Process**:
   - The `refundPlayers` function is called to refund participants:
     ```solidity
     function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
         Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
         if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
         for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
             // ... refund logic ...
             uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
             _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
             // ... more logic ...
         }
     }
     ```
   - Crucially, this function does not update `_lockedETH`.

5. **State After Refund**:
   - The contract's ETH balance has decreased by the refunded amount.
   - However, `_lockedETH` remains unchanged, now higher than the actual locked amount.

6. **Repeated Process**:
   - Steps 3-5 are repeated for multiple raffles, exacerbating the discrepancy.

7. **Withdrawal Attempt**:
   - The contract owner attempts to withdraw available ETH using `withdrawETH`:
     ```solidity
     function withdrawETH(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
         uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
         uint256 availableBalance;
         unchecked { availableBalance = balance - _lockedETH; }
         if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
         _sendETH(amount, msg.sender);
     }
     ```
   - This function calculates available balance as `balance - _lockedETH`.

8. **Withdrawal Failure**:
   - Due to the inflated `_lockedETH`, `availableBalance` is much lower than it should be.
   - The condition `if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();` is triggered, causing the withdrawal to fail.

9. **Result**:
   - The contract now holds ETH that should be available for withdrawal.
   - However, this ETH is effectively locked due to the inconsistency in `_lockedETH`.
   - The contract owner cannot withdraw these funds through normal means.


### Impact

Admins suffers from the inability to withdraw legitimately available ETH. The attacker doesn't directly gain ETH but can effectively grief the contract by locking funds. In extreme cases, this could lead to all ETH in the contract becoming non-withdrawable, even if it should be available.

### PoC



- Total ETH in contract: 10 ETH
- `_lockedETH`: 8 ETH (representing ETH locked for potential refunds)
- Available ETH for withdrawal: 2 ETH (10 ETH - 8 ETH)



1. A raffle (ID: 100) is cancelled. It had 4 participants who each contributed 2 ETH.

2. The contract owner calls `refundPlayers` to refund these 4 players:

```solidity
refundPlayers(100, [player1, player2, player3, player4])
```

3. The function successfully refunds 2 ETH to each player, totaling 8 ETH refunded.



After the refunds, the contract's state is:

- Total ETH in contract: 2 ETH (10 ETH - 8 ETH refunded)
- `_lockedETH`: Still 8 ETH (unchanged from before)
- Available ETH for withdrawal: -6 ETH (2 ETH - 8 ETH), which doesn't make sense



- The contract thinks it still needs to keep 8 ETH locked, even though it only has 2 ETH left.

- If there's a `withdrawETH` function that checks against `_lockedETH`, it would prevent any withdrawals because the contract thinks all remaining ETH (and more) is locked.

```solidity
function withdrawETH(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    uint256 availableBalance;
    unchecked { availableBalance = balance - _lockedETH; }
    if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
    // ... rest of withdrawal logic
}
```

In this case, `availableBalance` would be calculated as 2 ETH - 8 ETH = -6 ETH (underflow in unchecked block), making any withdrawal impossible.

Anyone querying the contract would think it has 8 ETH locked for refunds, when in reality all refunds have been processed.



### Mitigation

Consider updating locked ETH in refundPlayers. 

```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    // ... existing logic ...
    uint256 totalRefunded = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        // ... refund logic ...
        totalRefunded += amountToSend;
    }
+    unchecked {
+        _lockedETH -= totalRefunded;
+   }
}
```

After refunds with this fixed function:

- Total ETH in contract: 2 ETH
- `_lockedETH`: 0 ETH (8 ETH - 8 ETH refunded)
- Available ETH for withdrawal: 2 ETH (2 ETH - 0 ETH)
