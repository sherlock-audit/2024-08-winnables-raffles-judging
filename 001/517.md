# Indefinite Locking of Future ETH Due to `_lockedETH` Not Updated in `refundPlayers` Function in `WinnablesTicketManager` Contract

## Summary
The `refundPlayers` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract does not deduct total amount refunded from the `_lockedETH` variable at the end of its execution. This oversight results in future ETH from ticket purchases being unnecessarily locked in the contract, reducing the available balance for future operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `refundPlayers` function processes refunds for participants of a canceled raffle. However, it fails to update the `_lockedETH` variable to reflect the amount of ETH that has been refunded. As a result, the contract continues to consider the refunded ETH as locked, even though it has already been sent out. This causes future ETH from ticket purchases to be locked indefinitely as `_lockedETH` is not accurately decremented. When new ETH is received from future ticket purchases, it will be considered locked because `_lockedETH` is not accurately decremented.

## Impact
The failure to decrement `_lockedETH` after refunds locks future ETH purchases indefinitely, reducing available funds.
