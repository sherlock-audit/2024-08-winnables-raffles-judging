# Malicious user will prevent prize unlocking for cancelled raffles

### Summary

Trust of user input on permissionless function will cause raffles to be cancelled on the `WinnablesTicketManager` without the prize being unlocked on `WinnablesPrizeManager` as a malicious user could call this function on a cancellable raffle and supply an incorrect `prizeManager` address and `chainSelector` value.

### Root Cause

The choice to make `cancelRaffle` ([WinnablesTicketManager:L278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278)) an unprivileged function is a mistake as it requires two parameters which are trusted and not verified: `chainSelector` and `prizeManager`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An ongoing raffle must be in a cancellable state.
2. A prize must be locked for this raffle for exploitation to have impact.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. An unprivileged user calls `TicketManager.cancelRaffle`, supplying the `raffleId` of a cancellable raffle; any address for `prizeManager` other than the actual address; and/or any value for `chainSelector` other than `1`. 
2. The raffle's `status` is set to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED` and a CCIP message is sent with the supplied `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` values.
3. As the values in the CCIP message are incorrect, `WinnablesPrizeManager.ccipReceive` will not be called by the CCIP router on Ethereum mainnet. This means that `WinnablesPrizeManager._cancelRaffle` will not be called and the raffle's prize will not be unlocked.

### Impact

Winnables suffers the loss of the permanently locked prize for the cancelled raffle and the attacker doesn't gain anything (griefing).

### PoC

The test case below can be inserted into `test/TicketManager.js` in place of `'Cancels and sends cancellation CCIP Message'` ([line 521](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/TicketManager.js#L521))

```javascript 
   it('Unprivileged user cancels raffle and sends CCIP message with incorrect contract address and chainID, preventing correct cancelation flow', async () => {
      await (await link.mint(manager.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'))).wait();
      
      // Unprivileged user cancels raffle and sends CCIP message with incorrect prize manager address and chainID
      const tx = await manager.connect(signers[2]).cancelRaffle(signers[2].address, 2, 1);

      const { events } = await tx.wait();
      expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(3);
      const ccipMessageEvent = ccipRouter.interface.parseLog(events[0]);
      
      // CCIP message contains incorrect prize manager address and chainID
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.name).to.eq('MockCCIPMessageEvent');
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.args.data).to.eq('0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001');
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.args.receiver).to.eq('0x' + signers[2].address.toLowerCase().slice(-40).padStart(64, '0')); // incorrect receiver address
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.args.chain).to.eq('2'); // incorrect chainSelector

      // Subsequent attempt to cancel raffle with legitimate parameters reverts with InvalidRaffle as raffle is already cancelled
      await expect(manager.cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(manager, 'InvalidRaffle');
    });
```

### Mitigation

Two possible mitigations are:

1. `Winnables.TicketManager.cancelRaffle` could be made into an admin-only function.
2. `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` could be converted to state variables. These could be set at contract creation and/or through admin-only setter functions. `Winnables.TicketManager.cancelRaffle` could then be altered to accept only one parameter: `raffleId`.
