# _ccipContracts will not store sourceChainSelector informations correctly

### Summary

In `BaseCCIPContract.sol` the [`_packCCIPContract`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPContract.sol#L40) function removes any information about the `chainSelector` and sets it to zero for any value. Therefor the check in `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::_ccipReceive(..)` will not verify that the msg was send from one of the configured chains as all source chains will pass the check.

### Root Cause

In `BaseCCIPContract.sol:43` the function `_packCCIPContract` take the uint64 argument `chainSelector`. This will be shifted left by 160. This will make it too large for a uint64. Therefor the result will be truncated. As described in the solidity docs: "The result of a shift operation has the type of the left operand, truncating the result to match the type." [souce](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/types.html?highlight=shift#shifts)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

CCIP allows a number of chains to send msgs. It is possible that the attacker has his own contract deployed on another chain. That is why Winnables  added the check for the CCIP source chain. This check is not effective and an attacker can exploit it.

### Impact

The `_ccipReceive` is using the ineffective CCIP msg source chain check. The message send by the CCIP transaction contains the winner of the raffle. The attacker could therefor steal the whole raffle price.

### PoC

Update `BaseCCIPContract.sol` to make `_packCCIPContract` public for simpler testing:
```diff
@@ -37,7 +37,7 @@ contract BaseCCIPContract {
         _ccipContracts[counterpart] = enabled;
     }

+    function _packCCIPContract(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) public pure returns(bytes32) {
         return bytes32(
             uint256(uint160(contractAddress)) |
             uint256(chainSelector << 160)
```

Add POP to the `PriceManger.js`:
```diff

As you can see, the returned packed CCIPContract is not correct, as the chain is zero. This is the case for any `chainSelector`. So different selectors produce the same key for the mapping.

### Mitigation

The `chainSelector` should be casted to an uint256 first, than shifted:
