# ETH raffle type prize winner can drain WinnablesPrizeManager.sol's ETH balance

### Summary

_ClaimPrize()_ fails to follow CEI pattern, the function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L116-L122

In _ClaimPrize()_, ETH is sent out to prize winner before the rafflePrize.status is marked as claimed. 
```solidity
} else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```

So the prize winner can reenter so many times draining the contract's balance before the `rafflePrize.status` is marked as claimed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There need to be ETH balance in the contract even when ETH Raffle Prize amount is deducted (i.e an available ETH balance that doesn't belong to this particular ETH raffle prize winner)

### External pre-conditions

1. ETH Raffle Prize winner has to be a contract
2. He has to initiate the reentrancy attack in his receive() / fallback() function 

### Attack Path

1. ETH raffle type prize winner  first calls _ClaimPrize()_
2. When WinnablesPrizeManager.sol sends him ETH, he reenters and keeps reentering till he drains the whole ETH balance of the contract

### Impact

 WinnablesPrizeManager.sol can lose its whole ETH balance to a malicious ETH raffle type prize winner

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Follow CEI pattern in _ClaimPrize()_

I mean mark  the rafflePrize.status is marked as claimed before sending out the ETH
