# Attackers can cause winner to loss their raffle amount permanently due to missing access control

## Summary
Attackers can cause winners to lose their raffle amount permanently due to missing access control

## Vulnerability Detail
When a winner for a raffle has been set, a message is to be sent from the TicketManager to the PrizeManager to allow the rightful winner claim the raffle amount, this is done through the `propagateRaffleWinner()` function which can be called by anyone and can only be called once since it also updates the status of the raffle permanently. 
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
@>      raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        ...

@>      _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        ...
    }
```
The issue here is in the `_sendCCIPMessage()`, notice it takes in `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` as an argument. This means anyone can call this function passing in the wrong `prizeManager` and/or `chainSelector`, this would send the message to a wrong contract or chain but still sets the raffle status to PROPAGATED preventing anyone from calling it again causing winners to loss their raffle amount permanently.

## Recommendation
Consider making the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` a storage variable that can only be set by the admin and read from that instead of passing them in as an argument to the propagateRaffleWinner() function.
