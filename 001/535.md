# Logic error in _checkShouldCancel() function

## Summary
Raffle can be canceled even when it should not be.

## Vulnerability Detail
 _checkShouldCancel() function in the WinnablesTicketManager.sol contract contains a logic error that incorrectly allows a raffle to be canceled even when it should not be eligible for cancellation. This function is designed to ensure that a raffle can only be canceled if it meets specific criteria: the raffle must be in the IDLE state, it must have ended, and the number of tickets sold (supply) must be less than the minTicketsThreshold.

However, the current implementation of _checkShouldCancel only prevents cancellation if the supply of tickets is greater than the minTicketsThreshold. This leaves a loophole: if the supply is exactly equal to the minTicketsThreshold, the function allows the raffle to be canceled, even though the raffle has met the minimum ticket requirement and should proceed.

```jsx
  function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```
## Impact
This logic flaw can lead to the cancellation of raffles that have met the minimum ticket threshold, which should not be allowed. Such an action could unfairly prevent the raffle from concluding as intended, potentially leading to losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
This ensures that only raffles with a ticket supply below the threshold can be canceled.
