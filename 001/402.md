# lockedETH Is Not Updated When Users Are Refunded

## Summary

Due to lockedETH being not updated in the refund process ETH would be stuck in the contract / loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The users buy tickets paying in ETH and the amount paid is accounted in the lockedETH

2.) The raffle gets cancelled , imagine there were 100 ETH paid out as tickets and lockedETH would be 100 ETH

3.) The players would get a refund then here ->

4.) Now there is 0 eth in the contract but lockedEth still stores 100 ETH since it was not updated.

5.) Now another raffle begins , this time 110 ETH was paid up as tickets value , now there is 110 ETH as eth balance , and lockedETH  = 100 + 110 = 210 ETH and after `propagateRaffleWinner()` it would be 210 - 110 = 100 eth (L343)

6.) Raffle gets over , admin wants to withdraw the ETH now , calls withdrawETH() ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300

```solidity
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```

balance would be 110 ETH - 100 ETH = 10 ETH , and total eth is 110 ETH in the contract , therefore 100 ETH is stuck inside.

## Impact

Due to lockedETH being not updated in the refund process ETH would be stuck in the contract / loss of funds.
