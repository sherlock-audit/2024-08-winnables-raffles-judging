# `refundPlayers` can be DoS'd if a contract player can't receive ETH

### Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215

If a player in the `refundPlayers` function is a contract that cannot receive ETH (for example, due to a missing receive() or fallback() function), any attempt to refund that player will cause the entire transaction to revert. This means that if even one player among the participants cannot receive ETH for example if the API tries to refund All Players, the refund process for all players will fail. This effectively creates a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario, preventing all participants from being refunded simultaneously.

This issue directly contradicts one of the core principles outlined in the project's documentation: "Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded."

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the assumption that all players can receive ETH, without considering the scenario where a player is a contract that lacks the `receive` or `fallback` functions. the function `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` contract  `WinnablesTicket` checks if the contract is able to receive `ERC1155` tokens but this doesn't mean that it's able to accept ETH. If one of the players is a contract unable to accept ETH, the `refundPlayers` function will fail, potentially preventing all other players from being refunded.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `refundPlayers` function is invoked to return ETH to players who have participated in a game or raffle.
2. The list of players includes a contract address that does not have a `receive` or `fallback` function to accept ETH.

### External pre-conditions

1. An external user or contract initiates a refund process, calling `refundPlayers`.
2. One of the player addresses is a contract that cannot accept ETH transfers.

### Attack Path

Step 1: The `refundPlayers` function is called to distribute ETH to all participants.
Step 2: The function iterates through the list of players, attempting to send ETH to each address.
Step 3: When it reaches the contract address that cannot accept ETH, the transfer fails.
Step 4: Basedon how the refund logic is structured, the failure might cause the entire transaction to revert, preventing all subsequent refunds from occurring.
Step 5: As a result, none of the players receive their refunds, effectively causing a Denial of Service (DoS) for the refund process.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is a complete blockage of the refund process. If a single player in the list is a contract unable to receive ETH, no player can be refunded. This not only prevents the return of funds but can also erode trust in the contract or platform, especially in scenarios where refunds are expected to be quick and reliable.

### PoC

for simplicity I added a function in the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol`
```javascript
function setupCanceledRaffle(uint256 raffleId, uint256 refundAmount) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        raffle.totalRaised = refundAmount;
        _lockedETH = refundAmount;
    }
```

        vm.deal(address(ticketManager), REFUND_AMOUNT * 10);
        vm.prank(address(ticketManager));
        ticketManager.exposed_setupCanceledRaffle(RAFFLE_ID, REFUND_AMOUNT);

        attacker = new MaliciousReceiver();
    }

        // Set the attacker contract as an eligible player for refund

        // Perform the attack
        ticketManager.refundPlayers(RAFFLE_ID, players);

```

### Mitigation

1. Skipping addresses that fail the ETH transfer and continuing the refund process for other players.
2. Storing the refund information for failed transfers and allowing affected players to manually claim their refunds through a separate function.
