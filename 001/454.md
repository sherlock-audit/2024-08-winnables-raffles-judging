# Anyone could deprive winner of a prize or break unlock prize if raffile has been canceled

### Summary

Function propagateRaffleWinner and cancelRaffle allow specify prizeManager's address and chainselector. Anyone could call these functions with incorect prizeManager's address or chain selector. CCIP message will send to wrong address/chain. But new (next) status of raffle will set anyway, as call has sent to correct address. 

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicketManager.sol:334` and `WinnablesTicketManager.sol:278` user could specify address to ccip call. Arbitary call is possible.  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334

### Attack Path

There are 2 possible cases:
1. When raffle has status FULFILLED, attacker call propagateRaffleWinner() with incorect prizeManager or chain selector. CCIP request will sent to specified address and chain. Raffle status will set as PROPAGATED, but realy WinnablesPrizeManager will not receive ccip message. 
2. When _checkShouldCancel() allow cancel raffle, attacker call cancelRaffle with incorect prizeManager or chain selector. CCIP request will sent to specified address and chain. Raffle status will set as CANCELED, but realy WinnablesPrizeManager will not receive ccip message. 

### Impact

In first case, the winner could not get his prize, because prizeManager contract has not receive ccip message from ticket manager contract.
In second case, owner could not unlock locked prize, because prizeManager contract has not receive ccip message from ticket manager contract.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Dont allow to users specify address of prizeManager and chain selector. Use variables,which were set by owner in constructor.
