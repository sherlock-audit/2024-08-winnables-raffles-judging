# Anyone can all `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` with incorrect arguments causing the winner not to be able to claim the prize

### Summary

Once someone wins a raffle `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` has to be called in order for the winner to be able to claim the prize. The function also sets a raffle status to be `PROPAGATED` to not allow being called more times for the same raffle. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L337 
If the function is called with incorrect `prizeManager` or `chainSelector` the prize neither unlocks or gets allowed to be claimed in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. This could happen everytime a raffle is won.

### Root Cause

The function `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` is missing a modifier allowing only the admins to call it. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Someone needs to win a raffle, so the Chainlink VRF `fulfillRandomWords()` already needs to happen
2. The `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` has to be yet to called

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker will wait for the raffle status to become `FULFILLED`
2. Attacker will call the `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` with incorrect arguments before anyone else

### Impact

- The winner cannot claim his prize
- The winner cannot get refunded
- The admins cannot unlock the prize

### PoC

We can duplicate one of the already existing tests showing that first the function gets called with incorrect `chainSelector` and does not revert and afterwards if someone attempts to call it again with the correct arguments, it's no longer possible.

The test that was changed to show the following is the:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/TicketManager.js#L786

```js
it("Should be able to propagate when the winner is drawn", async () => {
      const { events } = await (
        await manager.propagateRaffleWinner(counterpartContractAddress, 137, 1)
      ).wait();
    });

it("Should be able to propagate when the winner is drawn", async () => {
      const { events } = await (
        await manager.propagateRaffleWinner(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1)
      ).wait();
    });
```

### Mitigation

A modifier allowing only admins to call this function should be added. Another option would be would be storing the prizeManager and chainSelector as storage variable with setter only allowed to be called by admins and these storage variables being referenced inside of WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner().
