# Incorrect check in WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawTokens  function so admins cannot perform partial withdrawals

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:295](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L295) the check is wrong

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The admins call withdrawTokens with amount < balance or amount > balance will revert

### Impact

1. Admins cannot perform partial withdrawals, potentially causing inconvenience.
2. Attempting to withdraw more than the available balance is allowed by this check, which could lead to confusing errors or unexpected behavior.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
```solidity
 function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
      // if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); remove this
      if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();  // add this
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
 }
```
