# attacker can prevent owner from withdrawing tokens

## **Summary**

attacker can easily block `withdrawTokens()` function in `WinnablesTicketManager` contract due to wrong check.

## **Vulnerability Detail**

lets check `withdrawTokens()` function:

```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

The function contains this check:

```solidity
if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```

but this should be implemented opposite, like this:

```solidity
if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```

the only way that owner be able to withdraw is setting input amount = balance of input token. the issue is attacker can front-run every withdraw transaction and transfer `1 wei` of input token to contract and make `withdrawTokens()` function revert.

the front-run will make balance greater than amount and as a result the owner transaction will revert.

```solidity
if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```

## **Impact**

DOS of `withdrawTokens()` function. An attacker can easily block the owner withdrawals.

## **Code Snippet**

```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## **Tool used**

Manual Review

## **Recommendation**

Consider modifying the `withdrawTokens()` function like this:

```diff
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
+        if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
