# A canceled raffle can draw a winner, and winner can transfer prize NFT and a refund ticket price eth, too.

### Summary

Invalid check and early exit from the if branch in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` internal function `_checkShouldCancel(raffleId)`  and missing check if `RaffleStatus is canceled` in both external function `drawWinner(raffleId)` and its helper internal function `_checkShouldDraw(raffleId)` leads to draw the winner for canceled raffle and propagate the winner message through `CCIP` to `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` where `claimPrize` also doesn't check if `RafflePrize status is canceled` which leads to winner getting the NFT prize and come back to `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` to get the price refund for the ticket from `refundPlayers()`

### Root Cause

During the cancellation of the raffle in [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:436](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L436)  function returns if a `PRIZE` is locked. The prize is locked first for every valid raffle contest as `RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED` is set while receiving the `ccip` message [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:381](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L381) Thus leading to pass the validation for every valid raffle and triggering the cancellation message to transmit in [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:282](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L282) Subsequently neither `drawWinner`   and it's helper function checks before drawing the winner if `RaffleStaus` is `CANCELED` or not.  [drawWinner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L310) and [_shouldDraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L422)

As the first cancellation message and then the winner is propagated to the `PrizeManager.sol` a winner is set at [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:275](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L275) and winner can call the `claimPrize` at [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105) to get the NFT prize as there is missing check if `RafflePrizeStatus is CANCELED or not` 

Again winner can call the `refundPlayers` [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:215](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215) to get the refund for the ticket purchased which got canceled.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Admins in `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol` lock the NFT as a prize.
  - Transmits the `CCIP` message
 - Admins in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` creates a new raffle with prize type NFT


### External pre-conditions

- The `raffle.endsAt` must surpass the `block.timestamp` and ticket sales must be higher than `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` to pass the checks inside of `_checkShouldDraw`
- The winner must have purchased the ticket to get the refund else the winner would still get the NFT prize.
- Admin shouldn't withdraw locked tokens as soon as the raffle gets canceled. Some minimal time gap is needed to execute the attack

### Attack Path

- External users can call `cancelRaffle` with the `prizeManager, chainSelector and raffleId` which further calls the internal helper function `_checkShouldCancel(raffleId)` which returns fulfilling the first if the condition of `if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;`  And the function `cancelRaffle` propagates the cancellation message through `CCIP`
- External users can call `drawWinner(raffleId)` which only checks for the external pre-conditions mentioned above. It doesn't check if the `raffleStatus` is `CANCELED` 
- External user can call `propagateRaffleWinner(prizeManager, chainSelector, raffleId)`  again not `raffleStatus` checked.
- The winner calls the `claimPrize(raffleId)` in `WinnablesPrizeManager` to get the NFT prize.
- Winner calls the `refundPlayers(raffleId, [address]` to get the refund for purchased ticket

### Impact

The attack best works for the NFT prize-type raffles as the first cancellation message removes/decreases the funds or unlocks the funds to withdraw.  The cancelled raffle winner can get both prize NFT and refund eth causing damage to the admins/manager entity which locked the prize.

### PoC

POC adds the existing unit test code of the project [test/PrizeManager.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/PrizeManager.js) 

```javascript

      await snapshot.restore();

    it('First Cancel Message', async () => {
      await (await manager.setCCIPCounterpart(counterpartContractAddress, 1, true)).wait();
      const tx = await whileImpersonating(ccipRouter.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>
        manager.connect(signer).ccipReceive({
          messageId: ethers.constants.HashZero,

        })
      );
      const { events } = await tx.wait();

    });
        
    it('Winner Message', async () => {

      const tx = await whileImpersonating(ccipRouter.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>
        manager.connect(signer).ccipReceive({
          messageId: ethers.constants.HashZero,
          sourceChainSelector: 1,

            winnablesDeployer.address.slice(-40).toLowerCase(),
          destTokenAmounts: []
        })
      );
      const { events } = await tx.wait();
      expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(1);
      expect(events[0].event).to.eq('WinnerPropagated');
    });

    it('Can claim the NFT now', async () => {
      const raffleWinner = await manager.getWinner(1);
      expect(raffleWinner).to.eq(signers[0].address);
      const tx = await manager.claimPrize(1);
      const { events } = await tx.wait();
      expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(2);
      const transferEvent = nft.interface.parseLog(events[0]);
      expect(transferEvent.name).to.eq('Transfer');
      const { from, to, tokenId } = transferEvent.args;
      expect(from).to.eq(manager.address);
      expect(to).to.eq(winnablesDeployer.address);
      expect(tokenId).to.eq(1);
      expect(events[1].event).to.eq('PrizeClaimed');
      const { raffleId, winner } = events[1].args;
      expect(raffleId).to.eq(1);
      expect(winner).to.eq(winnablesDeployer.address);
    });
  });


```


### Mitigation

- Add checks before drawing the winner if the `RaffleStatus` is canceled
