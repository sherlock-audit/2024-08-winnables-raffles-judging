# Denial of Service Vulnerability in Raffle Cancellation Logic

## Summary

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `cancelRaffle` function of the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. This flaw allows any user to prematurely cancel a raffle by manipulating the raffle's state from `PRIZE_LOCKED` to `CANCELED`, thus preventing the proper initiation of the raffle setup process which depends on the raffle being in the PRIZE_LOCKED state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The WinnablesPrizeManager.sol has three lock functions to lock the rewards i.e. ETH, NFT or TOKENS. Once this function is executing it sends a `ccipMessage` to the WinnablesTicketManager.sol . The purpose of this message is to inform the contract that a new prize has been locked and a raffle should be created for it. 

Upon receiving this message the _ccipReceive() function sets the status of the raffle through

```solidity
_raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;
```

The status is updated and prize is locked. After this createRaffle() has to be called by the admin to create a raffle with the right parameters so that the raffle can start but there is another function in the contract which allows a malicious user to DoS the creation of new raffles.

```solidity
    /// @notice (Public) Cancel a raffle if it can be canceled
    /// @param raffleId ID of the raffle to cancel
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];

        // @audit-issue malicious user can dos the contract
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return; // if prize is still locked then return

        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle(); 
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); 
    }
```

The first function cancelRaffle() calls the internal function _checkShouldCancel function to verify if the raffle can be cancelled. The 2nd function returns after executing 

if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;

The flow is not at the first function which will set the new status of the raffle to CANCELED. This will block the raffle from being created on this contract because to create the raffle a check inside createRaffle() function is present i.e.

```solidity
if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) revert PrizeNotLocked();
```

This causes the function to revert and the raffle can not be created.

## Impact

DoS of creation of raffles by calling cancelRaffle on the id of the raffle.
