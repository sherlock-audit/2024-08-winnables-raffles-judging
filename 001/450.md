# Attacker can drain `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` contract, due to reentrancy in `claimPrize` function

### Summary

Attacker can enter raffle by creating smart contract, he can drain `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` contract due to re-entrancy in `claimPrize` once he wins

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105

The  `claimPrize` function in `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` contract is not following CEI pattern and updating the claim status only after send ether/tokens to the winner. It should update the state before sending tokens/ether to the winner

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The raffle is created by the admin
2. The attacker will create a smart contract and enters raffle with that smart contract as a recipient of ticket.
3. Once the raffle is ended and if the winner is attacker's smart contract, 
4. The attacker can call `claimPrize` function in the receive or fallaback function in the smart contract to drain the `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` until it's balance becomes zero.
5. The attacker successfully able to drain the `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` contract and steal money

### Impact

Due to this, the attacker will be able to drain the balance of the contract `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` and protocol cannot be able to recover those funds as attacker will steal money

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, we have to follow the CEI pattern in the `claimPrize` function in `WinnablePrizeManager.sol` and we have to update the contract state before making any external interactions. Also it is would be better to use Openzeppelin Reentrancy gaurds and use NonReentrant modifier to `claimPrize` function.

            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;

        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            @audit check for reentrancy
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
