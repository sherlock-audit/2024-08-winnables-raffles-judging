# `_sendCCIPMessage` function does not check `ccipDestAddress` and `ccipDestChainSelector` arguments allowing anyone to propagate winner to an arbitrary chain and PrizeManager

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
`WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner` function is responsible to send raffle's winner to `PrizeManager`. its suppose to do so by sending a cross-chain message to `WinnableaPrizeManager` on mainnet:
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(
        address prizeManager, //@audit-info address of PrizeManager on ETH chain
        uint64 chainSelector, //@audit-info chainId of ETH
        uint256 raffleId //@audit-info the raffle Id
    ) external {
 Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
       //@audit-info must be fulfilled
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED)
            revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
       //@audit-info set status to propagated
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);
        //@audit-info send the CCIP message
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(
                uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN),
                raffleId,
                winner
            )
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
we know from code docs that this function is public (no access control):
```solidity
    /// @notice (Public) Send a cross-chain message to the Prize Manager to
    ///         mark the prize as claimable by the winner
    /// @param raffleId ID of the Raffle we wish to draw a winner for
```
and anyone is able to call this function with arbitrary `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`, however, if we look at `_sendCCIPMessage` we can see that there are no checks to validate that `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` are actually correct:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPSender.sol#L15-L50
this gives a malicious actor the opportunity to propagate winner to an incorrect chain or prizeManager, preventing rewards from being unlocked and given to actual winner.
Also, since raffle status is updated to `PROPAGATED` its not possible to call this function again with correct `prizeManager `and `chainSelector`:
```solidity
raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
```

`_ccipReceive` checks whether `senderAddress` and `sourceChainSelector` are  valid, similar checks must be implemented in `_sendCCIPMessage`:
```solidity
    function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        address _senderAddress = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(
            _senderAddress,
            message.sourceChainSelector
        );
        //@audit-info check if sender and source chain are valid
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
```
## Impact
Anyone is able to propagate a raffle to an incorrect `prizeManager` and chain, preventing raffle winner from receiving the rewards and locking rewards inside `WinnablesPrizeManager`

## Recommendation
Inside `_sendCCIPMessage` check whether target chain and `prizeManager` are supported
