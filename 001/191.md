# Admin can affect the odds of a raffle

## Summary

Admin can affect the odds of a raffle

## Vulnerability Detail

According to contest readme:

> The principles that must always remain true are:
> 
> Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize
> Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded
> Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

However, admin can directly mint Ticket by granting itself role 1.
```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
    if (to == address(0)) {
      revert TransferToAddressZero();
    }
    address operator = msg.sender;
    uint256 startId = _supplies[id];

    unchecked {
      _balances[id][to] += amount;
      _supplies[id] = startId + amount;
    }

    _ticketOwnership[id][startId] = to;
    emit NewTicket(id, startId, amount);
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
  }
```

Current state of the Raffle is not checked when minting, meaning that admin can still mint tickets even if `raffle.status = RaffleStatus.REQUESTED` or `raffle.status == RaffleStatus.FULFILLED`. So admin can mint some new tickets after seeing VRF results to force himself to win the raffle.

Such behavior breaks the principle that "Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle".

## Impact

Impact: high - a security principle can be broken

Likelihood: low - require a malicious admin

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`WinnablesTicket.mint` should check the status of current raffle.
