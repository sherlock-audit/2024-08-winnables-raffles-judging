# Refund Function Fails for ERC20 Token and NFT Raffles

## Summary
The `refundPlayers` function is limited to refunding only ETH . It does not currently support the return of ERC20 tokens or NFTs used in the raffle,making users who joined a raffle with NFTs or tokens unable to get their refunded amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The refundPlayers function is designed to handle refunds for players when a raffle is canceled. The function checks if the raffle status is CANCELED, and if so, proceeds to process refunds. However, the refund logic is currently implemented to handle only ETH refunds, as evidenced by the _sendETH function call, which is only appropriate for ETH transactions.

```solidity
 function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
```
This  means that ERC20 tokens and NFTs, which may also be used in raffles, cannot be refunded using this function. This creates a significant problem for users who participated using non-ETH assets.
## Impact
Players who participated in raffles using ERC20 tokens or NFTs will not be able to claim their refunds if the raffle is canceled. This will lead to a loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Implement appropriate refund logic based on the asset type and do a refund as shown below
 
 ```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);

        // Example of handling different asset types
        if (raffle.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
        } else if (raffle.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            _sendERC20(raffle.tokenAddress, amountToSend, player);
        } else if (raffle.assetType == AssetType.NFT) {
            _sendNFT(raffle.tokenAddress, amountToSend, player);
        }

        emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}

```
`_sendERC20` and  `_sendNFT` functions can be implemented to handle ERC20 and NFT transfers respectively as shown below,

```solidity
function _sendERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, address recipient) private {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    bool success = token.safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
    require(success, "ERC20 transfer failed");
}
``` 

```solidity
function _sendNFT(address nftAddress, uint256 tokenId, address recipient) private {
    IERC721 nft = IERC721(nftAddress);
    nft.safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);
}
```
**Make sure to test these functions thoroughly in a test environment before deploying them to production.**
