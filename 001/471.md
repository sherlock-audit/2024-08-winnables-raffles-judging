# ETH Balance Discrepancy in Raffle Refunds Causes Potential Fund Freezing

## Summary
A critical flaw has been identified in the WinnablesTicketManager contract's `refundPlayers` function. The function fails to adjust the `_lockedETH` variable when processing refunds, leading to a mismatch between the actual and recorded locked ETH amounts. This discrepancy can result in the unintended retention of funds within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue lies in the `refundPlayers` function's implementation:

1. When tickets are purchased, the `_lockedETH` value is increased.
2. Upon raffle cancellation and subsequent refunds, ETH is returned to players.
3. However, the `_lockedETH` variable remains unchanged during the refund process.

This oversight creates a growing disparity between the contract's ETH balance and the `_lockedETH` value over time, especially if multiple raffles are cancelled and refunded.

## Impact
The consequences of this vulnerability are significant:

1. Fund Immobilization: The contract owner may be unable to withdraw legitimately available ETH.
2. Misleading Contract State: The `_lockedETH` value will incorrectly suggest that more ETH is locked than actually is.
3. Potential for Abuse: An attacker could exploit this flaw to artificially inflate `_lockedETH`, effectively freezing the contract's funds.

In a worst-case scenario, this could render all ETH in the contract inaccessible through normal withdrawal mechanisms.

## Code Snippet
[Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215)
```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    require(raffle.status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED, "Raffle not canceled");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 refundAmount = calculateRefund(raffleId, player);
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            transferETH(player, refundAmount);
            // _lockedETH is not decreased here
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, implement the following changes:

1. Track the total refunded amount within the `refundPlayers` function.
2. Decrease `_lockedETH` by the total refunded amount at the end of the function.

Here's a proposed fix:

```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    require(raffle.status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED, "Raffle not canceled");
    
    uint256 totalRefunded = 0;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 refundAmount = calculateRefund(raffleId, player);
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            transferETH(player, refundAmount);
            totalRefunded += refundAmount;
        }
    }
    
    _lockedETH -= totalRefunded;
}
```

This modification ensures that `_lockedETH` accurately reflects the amount of ETH locked in active raffles after refunds are processed, preventing the fund locking issue and maintaining the contract's integrity.
