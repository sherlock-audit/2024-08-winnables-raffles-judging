# Unprotected Raffle Cancellation Enables Cross-Chain Timing Attacks and Protocol Disruption

# Summary

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract allows for the cancellation of raffles in the `PRIZE_LOCKED` state without adequate safeguards. This vulnerability creates a window of opportunity for malicious actors to disrupt the raffle creation process, leading to cross-chain inconsistencies, user confusion, and protocol instability.

# Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists in the [`_checkShouldCancel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L436-L437) function of the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. This function allows cancellation when the raffle status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`, as evidenced by the immediate return statement. This permissive check is then used in the public [`cancelRaffle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L279-L280) function. 

The vulnerability arises from the cross-chain nature of the protocol. When a prize is locked on Ethereum, a CCIP message is sent to set the raffle status to `PRIZE_LOCKED` on Avalanche. There's a time window between this status change and the admin calling `createRaffle` to finalize the raffle setup. During this window, anyone can call `cancelRaffle`.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. The attacker monitors the Ethereum chain for transactions to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract that lock prizes for new raffles.
2. When a new prize is locked, the `WinnablesPrizeManager` sends a CCIP message to the `WinnablesTicketManager` on Avalanche to set the raffle status to `PRIZE_LOCKED`.
3. The attacker observes this CCIP message and prepares a transaction to call `cancelRaffle` on the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract.
4. The attacker submits this cancellation transaction with a high gas price to increase the likelihood of it being processed before the admin's `createRaffle` transaction.
5. If successful, the attacker's `cancelRaffle` transaction is executed before the admin can set up the raffle parameters.
6. The `cancelRaffle` function changes the raffle status to `CANCELED` and sends a CCIP message back to Ethereum to unlock the prize.
7. This creates a state where the prize is unlocked on Ethereum, but no raffle actually took place, potentially confusing users and disrupting the protocol's operations.
8. The attacker can repeat this process for multiple raffles, causing widespread disruption and potentially damaging the protocol's reputation.

# Impact

1. Cross-chain Timing Attacks: Attackers can monitor the Ethereum chain for prize locking transactions and attempt to front-run the admin's `createRaffle` transaction with a `cancelRaffle` call on Avalanche.
2. Reputation Damage: Frequent cancellation attempts or successful cancellations of raffles in `PRIZE_LOCKED` state could make the protocol appear unstable, discouraging user participation.
3. CCIP Message Spam: An attacker could generate a high volume of CCIP messages by repeatedly attempting to cancel raffles, potentially congesting the cross-chain messaging system and draining LINK tokens used for CCIP fees.

# Tool used

Manual Review

# Recommendation

- Implement Time-based Protection: Add a time lock preventing cancellation for a set period after a prize is locked. This gives admins a window to set up the raffle without interference.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _prizeLockTimestamp;

function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) {
        require(block.timestamp > _prizeLockTimestamp[raffleId] + 1 hours, "Cannot cancel within 1 hour of prize locking");
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

- Rate Limiting: Implement a cooldown period for cancellation attempts to prevent rapid, repeated calls.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private _lastCancellationAttempt;

function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
    require(block.timestamp > _lastCancellationAttempt[msg.sender] + 15 minutes, "Please wait before attempting to cancel again");
    _lastCancellationAttempt[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

- Admin-only Cancellation in `PRIZE_LOCKED` State: Restrict cancellation in `PRIZE_LOCKED` state to admin accounts only.

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) {
        require(_hasRole(msg.sender, 0), "Only admin can cancel in PRIZE_LOCKED state");
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
