# Unauthorized Actors Will Prevent the Raffle Winner from Claiming Their Prize

### Summary

The missing access control on the `propagateRaffleWinner` function in `WinnablesTicketManager` will cause a disruption in the prize distribution for the raffle winner as an unauthorized actor (e.g., a losing player) can call this function and provide an incorrect `prizeManager` address, preventing the legitimate winner from claiming the prize.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager::334](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334) the propagateRaffleWinner function lacks access control, allowing any external account to invoke the function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Any external account needs to call `propagateRaffleWinner()` with a chosen `prizeManager` address.

### External pre-conditions

1. The provided `prizeManager` address is incorrect, causing the winner's prize claim to fail on the actual `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.

### Attack Path

1. An unauthorized actor (e.g., a losing player) calls the `propagateRaffleWinner()` function and sets an incorrect prizeManager address.
2. The raffle status is updated to PROPAGATED.
3. The message is sent using `_sendCCIPMessage()` but is directed to the incorrect `prizeManager`, making the prize unclaimable by the legitimate winner.
4. The legitimate winner is unable to receive their prize, causing dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust in the raffle system.

### Impact

The raffle winner suffers a loss as they are unable to claim their prize due to the incorrect propagation of the winner's information. The attacker doesn't gain anything directly but causes a denial of service by preventing the rightful winner from claiming the prize.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement proper access control by restricting the `propagateRaffleWinner` function to only be callable by the raffle creator (admin) or a trusted role. Additionally, consider verifying the `prizeManager` address before proceeding with the propagation.
