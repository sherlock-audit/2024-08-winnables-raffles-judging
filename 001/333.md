# Cancel Raffle Front-Running/Access Control Attack

### Summary

A missing check in **cancelRaffle** allows a malicious user to cancel a raffle immediately after prize locking before the admin can create the raffle. This prevents the raffle from being created, causing potential loss of funds and disrupt the entire raffle process. This stems from the factthat the raffle creation is a two step process where first the prize is locked and then the owner creates the raffle.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the lack of proper access control and checks in the **cancelRaffle** function, which exposes a vulnerability where any user can cancel a raffle during a critical window between the prize being locked and the raffle being created. The **cancelRaffle** has external visibility. This function calls **_checkShouldCancel** function to check if raffle could be cancelled, which allows cancelling if the prize is locked. 

This is the cancelRaffle function:
`
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
`

Which further calls the _checkShouldCancel function:

`
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
`

This line allows cancelling if prize is locked:
`      if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The prize is locked via _ccipReceive function (CCIP message).
2. The cancelRaffle function is external and accessible to all users.
3. There is a window of opportunity between prize locking and raffle creation.


### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker must front-run the admin's createRaffle transaction.
2. The attacker must know the prize ID to call cancelRaffle.

### Attack Path

The prize is locked via **_ccipReceive**.
The attacker calls **cancelRaffle** immediately after the prize is locked.
Admin attempts to call **createRaffle** but fails as the raffle is now invalid.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a 100% loss of funds and potential raffle proceeds. The attacker does not gain any funds from cancellation but succeeds in causing operational disruption and preventing raffle creation.

Example:

Admin intended to create a raffle with a prize
An attacker front-runs and cancels the raffle before it is created, making the prize go unused and causing operational delays.

### Mitigation

Don't allow external users to be able to cancel raffles when the prize is locked.
