# M-03 Incorrect Balance Check in `withdrawTokens` Leads to Token Lockup and Transaction Failures.

### Summary

In the `withdrawTokens` function of the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, an incorrect condition causes the function to revert prematurely, resulting in an inability to withdraw any ERC20 tokens. Specifically, the logic in the condition `if (amount < balance)` erroneously checks if the withdrawal amount is less than the contract's balance, which leads to a revert in cases where a withdrawal should be allowed. Consequently, when the amount is greater than the balance, the function attempts to process the withdrawal, but the transfer fails due to insufficient funds, creating a persistent failure in the withdrawal mechanism.

### Root Cause

The erroneous condition `if (amount < balance)` on line 295 in the `withdrawTokens` function causes unnecessary reverts and allows withdrawal attempts to proceed when the requested amount exceeds the contract's balance. The correct condition should be `if (amount > balance)` to ensure that the withdrawal only proceeds if the contract has sufficient funds to cover the requested amount, but the current condition reverts the transaction when it should succeed.

Code Location: `WinnablesTicketManager.sol`
Relevant Line: `if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();` on line 295

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract holds ERC20 tokens in a positive balance.
2. The function is called by an address with admin role `onlyRole(0)`.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The admin calls `withdrawTokens()` with a valid `token address` and an `amount` less than the current balance.
2. The condition `if (amount < balance)` triggers, and the function reverts, preventing the withdrawal.
3. If the admin calls `withdrawTokens()` with an `amount` greater than the balance, the function proceeds but fails during the `safeTransfer` call due to insufficient funds, leading to a failed transaction.

### Impact

The issue with the incorrect condition in the withdrawal function leads to a scenario where tokens are effectively locked within the contract. The flawed `if` statement causes the function to revert when the `amount < balance`, preventing legitimate withdrawals. Conversely, when an attempt is made to withdraw more than the available balance, the `safeTransfer` call fails, making the withdrawal function unusable.

This creates a critical problem where the tokens remain stuck in the contract with no way to withdraw them, resulting in a permanent loss of access to these assets. Operationally, this could halt the contract's intended functionality, causing delays and potentially significant financial losses, as the contract's assets become inaccessible.

### PoC
1. Scenario 1: The contract holds 100 tokens of an ERC20 token, and the admin calls `withdrawTokens(tokenAddress, 50)`:

    * The condition `if (amount < balance)` is true because (50 is less than 100), and the function incorrectly reverts with `InsufficientBalance()`. This blocks a valid withdrawal despite sufficient funds being present.

2. Scenario 2: The admin calls `withdrawTokens(tokenAddress, 150)` where the requested amount exceeds the available balance:

    * The condition `if (amount < balance)` is false (150 is greater than 100), so the function proceeds, but the `safeTransfer` call fails due to insufficient balance, causing a revert. This further locks the tokens in the contract, as no withdrawal is successfully processed.

### Mitigation

Replace the condition `if (amount < balance)` on line 295 with `if (amount > balance)` to ensure that the function only reverts when the requested amount exceeds the available balance:

```solidity
if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```
