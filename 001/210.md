# Drawable raffle can be canceled.

### Summary

Drawable raffle can be canceled.

### Root Cause

In `_checkShouldDraw`, `supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is required.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L431
```solidity
        uint256 currentTicketSold = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (currentTicketSold == 0) revert NoParticipants();

        if (block.timestamp < raffle.endsAt) {
            if (currentTicketSold < raffle.maxTicketSupply) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        }
        if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
``` 

In `_checkShouldCancel`, `supply <= raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is required.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L440
```solidity
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
``` 

So when `supply == raffle.minTicketsThreshold` and `block.timestamp >= raffle.endsAt`, this raffle can be both drawn and canceled.

This does not conform to the usage of the threshold, normally if it equals the threshold, it should not be canceled.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will lead to the cancellation of a raffle that could have been completed normally, users will waste time and the protocol will also failed to generate revenue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `_checkShouldCancel`, `supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold` -> `supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold`.
