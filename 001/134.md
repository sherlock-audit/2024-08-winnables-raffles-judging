# WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize does not follow CEI

### Summary

[`claimPrize()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) does not follow Checks effects and interactions pattern, as a result this function can potentially be re-entered and even possibly prizes be drained.

### Root Cause

`claimPrize` updates state before performing checks, hence non-compliant to CEI.

### Internal pre-conditions

caller needs to provide the right RaffleID

### External pre-conditions

Attacker needs to perform his call to `claimPrize()` with his malicious contract.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker designs an attacking contract that will perform the stealing of prizes recursively to drain protocol
2. Attacker calls `claimPrizes()` with the right raffleID from the attacking contract
3. Attacker drains prizes

### Impact

`claimPrize` is vulnerable to reentrancy and protocol can be drained by attackers

### PoC

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```
Above is `claimPrize()` as we can observe the checks in the function are performed last before the `emit` and thus after state changing calls. This is dangerous because it can lead to attackers draining protocol because the checks are after the state has changed.

### Mitigation

Re-implement function to follow CEI pattern or use a reentrancy guard from openzeppelin.
