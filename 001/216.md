# Ethers of refunded amount for canceled raffle will be locked for the next raffles.

## Summary
`WinnablesTicketManager` registers and updates locked ethers as `_lockedETH` state variable in order to refund ethers to participants for canceled raffle or withdraw ethers to admin for ticket sales.
However, `WinnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()` doesn't reduce `_lockedETH` and it causes locked amount of ethers to be smaller than `_lockedETH` value by refunded amount of ethers.
Therefore, admin can't withdraw ethers of already refunded amount for the next raffles. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`WinnablesTicketManager` registers and updates locked ethers as `_lockedETH` state variable in order to refund ethers to participants for canceled raffle or withdraw ethers to admin for ticket sales. Therefore, `_lockedETH` value should be synced with really locked amount of ethers.
The `_lockedETH` is increased whenever participants buy tickets in `buyTickets()` and is decreased whenever raffles finishes successfully in `propagateRaffleWinner()`. However it is not updated in the following `WinnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()` function.
```solidity
    function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function doesn't reduce `_lockedETH` state variable while it refunds ethers to pariticpants and reduces really locked ethers amount.

Example:
1. Admin creates raffle with `raffleId = 1`.
2. A particpant buys ticket with `2 ethers`. Now `_lockedETH = 2 ethers`.
3. Admin cancels `raffleId = 1` and refunds ethers to the participant. Now token manager's ETH balance is zero but `_lockedETH` is still `2 ethers` becasue `refundPlayers()` doesn't reduce it.
4. Admin creates another raffle with `raffleId = 2`.
5. A participant buys ticket with `3 ethers`. Now `_lockedETH = 5 ethers` and ETH balance is `3 ethers`.
6. Raffle finishes successfuly and `_lockedETH` will be `2 ethers` in `propagateRaffleWinner()`.
7. Admin can withdraw only `1 ether` because ETH balance is `3 ethers` and `_lockedETH` is `2 ethers`. 
8. As a result, `2 ethers` ETH will be locked to token manager contract.

## Impact
Ethers of refunded amount for canceled raffle will be locked for the next raffles.

## Recommendation
Modify `WinnablesTicketManager.refundPlayers()` function as follows.
```solidity
    function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
++          _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
