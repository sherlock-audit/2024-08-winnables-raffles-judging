# Raffle Cancellation Vulnerability Allows Denial of Service (DOS) Attack

## Summary

The `cancelRaffle` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract contains a vulnerability that allows any user to cancel raffles that are not yet started. This opens the door for malicious users to conduct a Denial of Service (DOS) attack, where they can cancel all raffles, preventing the protocol from operating as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_checkShouldCancel` function determines whether a raffle is eligible for cancellation based on several conditions. One of these conditions checks whether the raffle's status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`:

```solidity
if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
```

This check allows any user to cancel a raffle as long as it is in the `PRIZE_LOCKED` status. The issue here is that a malicious user can abuse this function to cancel raffles that are not yet started, which could prevent raffles from being executed.

Since there is no restriction on who can invoke this function, this vulnerability can be exploited to DOS the protocol by canceling all raffles before they can start.

## Impact

A malicious user could effectively DOS the protocol by canceling all raffles, preventing any raffles from starting. This could severely disrupt the protocol's operation and cause significant financial loss to both the protocol and its users.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_checkShouldCancel` function to ensure that only the admin or owner can cancel a raffle that has not yet started:

```solidity
if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED && msg.sender == ADMIN) return;
```

This additional check will prevent unauthorized users from canceling raffles and ensure that only trusted accounts can cancel raffles that have not yet started.
