# Attacker can force `WinnablesTicketManager` to send CCIP message to wrong destination

## Summary

Currently, `WinnablesTicketManager.cancelRaffle` has no access control, which means anyone can call it with any `chainSelector`. This in turn prevents the reward from being taken out on Ethereum.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a raffle can be canceled for some reason, function `cancelRaffle` is used to notify WinnablesPrizeManager(on Ethereum) that rewards are ready to be unlocked and removed:

    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }

Since this function has no access control, and there is no internal verification that `prizeManager` and `cancelRaffle` are correct destinations, anyone can call this function to set `_raffles[raffleId].status` to `CANCELED` and send message to another chain supported by CCIP.

The result of this attack is that the status of the raffle on Avalanche has been set to `CANCELED`, but the raffle is still valid on Ethereum, so the reward cannot be taken out by admin and forever locked.

## Impact

Severity: HIGH - direct fund loss, admin cannot access funds locked in `WinnablesTicketManager` permanently.
Likelihood: HIGH - anyone can do this on a cancellable raffle.

Impact: HIGH

## Recommendation

Add an access control on `cancelRaffle`, or validate users' input params.
