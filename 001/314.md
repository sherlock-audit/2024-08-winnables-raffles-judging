# Incorrect Balance Check in withdrawTokens Function

### Summary

The withdrawTokens function in the WinnablesTicketManager contract contains a logic error in its balance check. This error prevents any token withdrawals and effectively locks all ERC20 tokens in the contract permanently.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability is located in the withdrawTokens function:

`function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
    IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}`

The issue lies in the balance check condition:
`if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();`

This condition is incorrect. It reverts the transaction if the requested withdrawal amount is less than the contract's token balance. This is the opposite of the intended behavior, which should allow withdrawals up to the available balance.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The admin user's call would always revert if they try to withdraw tokens.

### Impact

Token Locking: All ERC20 tokens sent to this contract become permanently locked. The function will always revert unless someone attempts to withdraw more tokens than the contract holds, which would then fail at the transfer stage.

Functionality Loss: The intended administrative function to recover tokens is completely non-functional.

Financial Loss: Any tokens accidentally sent to the contract or accumulated through legitimate means (e.g., fees) cannot be retrieved, leading to potential financial losses for the project or its users.

### PoC

Not Required.

### Mitigation

Invert the check used in the function.
