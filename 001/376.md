# Incorrect Ticket Threshold Logic for Raffle Cancellation in WinnablesTicketManager Contract

## Summary

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract contains logic that determines whether a raffle should draw a winner or be canceled based on ticket sales and time conditions. However, there is a nuanced issue in the `_checkShouldCancel` and `_checkShouldDraw` functions concerning the condition `supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract has two checks involving ticket sales thresholds:

1. **In `_checkShouldDraw`:** It ensures a raffle can draw a winner if ticket sales (`currentTicketSold`) are greater than or equal to a minimum threshold (`minTicketsThreshold`).
2. **In `_checkShouldCancel`:** It determines whether to cancel a raffle if ticket sales (`supply`) are below this threshold.

The issue arises because of the inverse logic check in `_checkShouldCancel`. To cancel a raffle, the function checks if the number of tickets sold is **greater than** the minimum threshold (`supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold`) and reverts if true, confusing the intended condition.

## Impact

The impact of this issue is that raffles may not be correctly canceled if the condition is improperly checked or if the logic is misinterpreted by developers and auditors. This can lead to unwanted behavior, such as raffles remaining open despite not meeting the sales threshold, or being canceled incorrectly.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L422
```solidity
function _checkShouldDraw(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    uint256 currentTicketSold = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (currentTicketSold == 0) revert NoParticipants();

    if (block.timestamp < raffle.endsAt) {
        if (currentTicketSold < raffle.maxTicketSupply) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    }
    if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L434
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); // Issue: Incorrect logic for cancellation
}
```

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To accurately reflect the conditions where a raffle should be canceled, modify the logic in the `_checkShouldCancel` function:

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); // Corrected logic
}
```

By ensuring the condition aligns correctly with the intended behavior, we avoid potential cancellation errors and maintain the integrity of the raffle's lifecycle.
