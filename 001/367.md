# Incorrect track of lockedETH may cause lock of funds

## Summary
The WinnablesTicketManager contract fails to properly update the _lockedETH variable when [refunding players](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215-L228) after a raffle cancellation, it will not substract _lockedETH to the amount the player is getting from the refund. This discrepancy between the actual contract balance and _lockedETH can lead to a situation where funds become locked in the contract, preventing withdrawals and potentially disrupting the protocol's operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the refundPlayers function, when ETH is refunded to players after a raffle cancellation, the _lockedETH variable is not decreased accordingly. This leads to a growing discrepancy between the actual ETH balance of the contract and the _lockedETH value over time, especially if multiple raffles are cancelled.
The issue is exacerbated by the [withdrawETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300-L306) function, which calculates the withdrawable amount as the difference between the contract's balance and _lockedETH:
```solidity
withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
    uint256 balance;
    unchecked {
->      balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
    }
    _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
}
```
As _lockedETH remains artificially high due to the lack of adjustment during refunds, this calculation can result in an underflow, causing the withdrawal to fail.

since it will not have the underflow (big number) amount of ETH to send with value:amount
```solidity
    function _sendETH(uint256 amount, address to) internal {
        if (amount == 0) revert NothingToSend();
  -> (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
```

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe:

Funds can become permanently locked in the contract, as the withdrawETH function will consistently fail due to the inflated _lockedETH value.
The protocol's ability to manage its ETH balance is compromised, potentially leading to a complete halt of operations.
Since they can't withdraw the money collected from the tickets

## Code Snippet
The following part with showcase a potential situation in which the admin can't withdraw the money collected from the tickets sales.

### 1) Initial State:
Raffle 1: 4 players, 1 ETH each
Raffle 2: 3 players, 1 ETH each
Total Balance: 7 ETH
_lockedETH: 7 ETH

### 2)Raffle 1 Cancellation and Refunds:

4 ETH refunded to players
New Balance: 3 ETH
_lockedETH remains at 7 ETH (not decreased during refunds)

### 3)Raffle 2 Completes:

Winner drawn and propagated
_lockedETH decreased by 3 ETH: 7 ETH - 3 ETH = 4 ETH

### 4)Admin Attempts to Withdraw
Actual Balance: 3 ETH
_lockedETH: 4 ETH
Calculation: 3 - 4 = -1 (which, due to unchecked underflow, becomes a very large number)

### 5) The _sendETH function will fail because the contract doesn't have enough ETH to send this large (incorrect) amount.

The below POC illustrates the situation described above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Decrease _lockedETH when refunds are issued
```solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    // ... existing code ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        // ... existing refund logic ...
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= amountToSend;
        }
    }
}
```
