# refund transfers might fail if the players array is too large and if a player is a smart contract that can't receive eth

### Summary

The refundPlayers function in WinnablesTicketManager.sol is responsible for refunding ETH to players when a raffle is canceled. However, this function has two issues: potential out-of-gas errors if the players array is too large, and the possibility of refund transfers failing if a player is a smart contract that cannot receive ETH.

### Root Cause

Using Push pattern instead of pull

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the players array is too large, the function may run out of gas, causing the transaction to fail and preventing refunds.

If any player is a smart contract that cannot accept ETH, the refund transfer will fail, potentially causing the entire transaction to revert.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider refactoring the refund function to use a PULL pattern where every participant can call a claim refund for himself.
