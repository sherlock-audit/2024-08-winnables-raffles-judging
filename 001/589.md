# `WinnablesTicketManager::refundPlayers` will revert half way before refunding all users

## Summary
In the `refundPlayers` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager` if a player has already been refunded, the function will revert the entire transaction, causing all subsequent refunds to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
in `for loop` of [refundPlayers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L221) function it iterates through an array of player addresses and processes refunds. If a player has already been refunded, indicated by the `PlayerAlreadyRefunded` condition, the function reverts the entire transaction.

**Example Scenario:**

- An array of 10 player addresses is passed to refundPlayers.
- The 3rd player in the array has already been refunded.
- The function reverts the transaction, and refunds for players 4 through 10 are not processed.

## Impact
The entire refund process fails if any player has already been refunded, which could lead to failed transactions and users may not receive their refunds

## Recommendation
Use `continue` instead `revert`

 ```solidity
if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) {
            // Skip already refunded players
            unchecked { ++i; continue; }
        }
```
