# Possible DOS in refundPlayers()

## Summary
Possible DOS in refundPlayers() function

## Vulnerability Detail
The refundPlayers() function in the WinnablesTicketManager.sol contract is vulnerable to DOS attack. This function is intended to refund ETH to participants of a raffle that has been canceled. It does this by iterating over an array of players addresses and sending ETH to each one in a for loop.
```jsx
    function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```

However, if one of the players is a malicious actor, he could deploy a smart contract with a receive function that intentionally reverts the transaction, preventing all players from receiving their refunds. This makes it possible for a malicious actor to block refunds for all participants by causing the transaction to fail.

## Impact
DOS leading to - users can not claim there funds.

## Recommendation
Do not use array, instead do one refund at a time.
