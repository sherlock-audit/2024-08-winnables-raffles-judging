# Possible DOS in raffle setup mechanism

### Summary

Method `cancelRaffle()` has external visibility. The raffle is cancellable by anyone until the owner defines the raffle with `createRaffle()`. A malicious user can cancel the raffle as soon as the ccip message is received. This will cause DOS as every raffle is cancellable. Also, it'll burn owner's LINK token on every cancellation call that are in the contract to pay ccip messaging fee.

### Root Cause

Since `cancelRaffle()` is accessible to anyone and raffle creation takes additional step from the owner, A malicious can always cancel a raffle without fail.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The owner locks an asset on ETH chain and a ccip message is sent to AVAX chain with raffleId.
2. The AVAX chain receives the message and set raffle status as PRIZE_LOCKED.
3. A malicious user calls `cancelRaffle()` and cancels the raffle before the owner could `createRaffle()`.

### Impact

The protocol will be useless as no raffle will work.

### PoC

The following test case passes without fail.
```javascript
it('Cancels and sends cancellation CCIP Message', async () => {
  let randomUser = await getWalletWithEthers();
  const tx = await manager.connect(randomUser).cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1);
  const { events } = await tx.wait();
  expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(3);
  const ccipMessageEvent = ccipRouter.interface.parseLog(events[0]);
  expect(ccipMessageEvent.name).to.eq('MockCCIPMessageEvent');
  expect(ccipMessageEvent.args.data).to.eq('0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001');
});
```

### Mitigation

To avoid DOS I would suggest to only allow owner to cancel the raffle if the raffle state is in `PRIZE_LOCKED` state.
