# CCIP Message manager can accept messages from unapproved contracts due to wrong packing operation

## Summary
In Winnables system, CCIP is used in order to cross chain messaging and there is a mechanism for whitelisting the contracts for message receiving. It can accept messages from non-whitelisted contracts due to wrong packing operation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whitelisted contracts are stored in _ccipContracts variable:
```solidity
    function _setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) internal {
&>      bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(contractAddress, chainSelector);
        _ccipContracts[counterpart] = enabled;
    }
```
This counter part is checked in receive message function in order to be safe against fault messages.
```solidity
function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
&>      if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
        (uint256 raffleId) = abi.decode(message.data, (uint256));
```
But packing function is implemented wrongly and, it can cause accepting messages from non-whitelisted contracts.

Packing function:
```solidity
    function _packCCIPContract(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) internal pure returns(bytes32) {
        return bytes32(
            uint256(uint160(contractAddress)) |
            uint256(chainSelector << 160)
        );
    }
```
It should store chain selector and contract address of the outside contract. But execution sequence in shifting operation is wrong because chainSelector is uint64 type and, after shifting 160 bits to left, it always going to be 0 in this situation. 

## Impact
Non-whitelisted contracts which has same address from unapproved chains can manipulate any raffle in the system and also win every raffle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Packing operation should convert chainSelector to uint256 before shifting 160 bits to left.
