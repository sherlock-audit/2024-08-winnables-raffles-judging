# Admin Can Manipulate Raffle Outcomes by Minting Unlimited Tickets

### Summary

Here’s the rephrased version:

The admin has the ability to assign any role to any user via the `Roles::setRole` function and uses this capability to grant themselves the `1` role in the `WinnablesTicket` contract:

```solidity
    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status);
    }
```

With the `1` role, the admin can directly mint tickets using the `WinnablesTicket` contract's `mint` function. This function is intended to be invoked through the `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function, which enforces checks for raffle duration, `maxHoldings`, and `maxTickets` via the `_checkTicketPurchaseable` internal function:

```solidity
    function buyTickets(uint256 raffleId,uint16 ticketCount,uint256 blockNumber,bytes calldata signature) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
```

The conditions within `_checkTicketPurchaseable` ensure that tickets can only be purchased within the raffle's duration, and that a single user can only purchase tickets up to the `maxTickets` limit.

However, when the [`WinnablesTicket::mint` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182-L199) is called directly, these conditions are not enforced. This allows the admin to mint an unlimited number of tickets without any restrictions, even after the raffle duration has ended.

Since the admin can mint tickets freely after the raffle's duration has expired, they avoid any potential losses from issuing additional tickets.

As a result, the admin can allocate these tickets to selected individuals or themselves, thereby manipulating the raffle’s outcome. By issuing an excessive number of tickets, the admin can artificially increase the chances of certain participants or themselves winning the raffle.

### Root Cause

The `mint` function in the `WinnablesTicket` contract does not enforce constraints like `maxHoldings` or `maxTickets`, allowing admin with the `1` role to mint an arbitrary number of tickets.

### Internal pre-conditions

The admin assigns themselves the `1` role in `WinnablesTicket` contract, which grants the ability to call the `mint` function.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The admin assigns themselves the `1` role within the `WinnablesTicket` contract.
2. The admin calls the `mint` function to create an unlimited number of tickets, bypassing any restrictions related to `maxHoldings` or `maxTickets`.
3. The admin mints these tickets for a specific participant, significantly increasing their chances of winning the raffle.
4. The raffle proceeds, but the outcome is manipulated, with the favored participant holding a disproportionate number of tickets compared to others.

### Impact

Users suffer from a skewed and unfair raffle where the chances of winning are artificially manipulated by the admin.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict the `WinnablesTicket::mint` function so that it can only be called by the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. Create a `TicketManager` variable and function that sets the variable with `WinnablesTicketManager` contract's address value. Add the following lines to the `WinnablesTicket::mint` function:
```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
++    if(msg.sender != address(WinnablesTicketManager)) revert;
    if (to == address(0)) {
      revert TransferToAddressZero();
    }
    address operator = msg.sender;
    uint256 startId = _supplies[id];

    unchecked {
      _balances[id][to] += amount;
      _supplies[id] = startId + amount;
    }

    _ticketOwnership[id][startId] = to;
    emit NewTicket(id, startId, amount);
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
  }
```
