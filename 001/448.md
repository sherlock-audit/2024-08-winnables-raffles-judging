# Attacker Can Break The Entire Winner Logic Via propagateRaffleWinner

## Summary

Attacker can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` with a receiver of his choice and grief the actual winner , the winner would never receive the prize.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Let's assume the users have participated in the raffle and have received their tickets . Now the winner can be drawn and `drawWinner()` is called ->

2.) From the VRF the `fulfillRandomWords()` callback is called and the random number is assigned based on which winner will be decided ,

3.) At this point winner is decided since the random number is known , either way our attacker can be anyone else not even a participant and he does the following ->

4.) Attacker calls `propagateRaffleWinner()` but provides a `prizeManager` address which is not the actual prize manager contract ,

5.) _sendCCIPMessage is invoked which doesnt verify this prize manager address and sends a message there , lets assume its some random receiver capable of receiving messages.

6.) Raffle status is set to propagated ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L337

7.) Therefore , now `propagateRaffleWinner` cannot be called again for this raffle (L336), meaning the actual winner will never be assigned for this raffle in the prize manager.

8.) Winner has lost his rewards.

## Impact

Attacker can call the `propagateRaffleWinner` with a receiver of his choice and grief the actual winner , the winner would never receive the prize. The prizes would be locked forever in the ticket manager.
