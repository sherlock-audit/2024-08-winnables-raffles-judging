# Winners Can Successfully Call `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` Twice Before Detection, Resulting in Double Withdrawal from the Protocol



## Summary
**description** The announced winner can withdraw their prize twice before the system's check prevents additional withdrawals. This issue affects both ETH and token prize withdrawals. The problem lies in the WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize function, which only verifies if the winner has claimed their prize after the transactions are complete. As a result, by the time the check is performed, the transactions allowing double withdrawals have already been processed.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. plug in this PoC into the `PrizeManager.js` testing file below the following test:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/PrizeManager.js#L782

2. This test demonstrates that we expect the claim function to revert. However, the balance before and after the second claim shows an increase, indicating that the winner was able to claim twice. The check only detects the issue after the third attempt, preventing further claims and effectively stopping the winner from claiming a third time.

## Impact
The impact this has on the protocol is loss of additional funds that are not expected, this is open up to all winners from any raffle.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation is to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern by moving the RafflePrizeStatus check to the beginning of the claimPrize function. Additionally, before executing any transactions, the status should be updated to "claimed." This ensures that any attempt to claim a prize a second time is blocked before any transactions are made.

```diff
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
+       if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
+       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
+           rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
