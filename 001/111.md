# Attacker can permanently lock owners tokens with malicious input in `cancleRaffle`

## Summary
Since the inputs in `cancelRaffle` aren't validated, an attacker can use malicious inputs to permanently lock owners NFTs, ETH, or tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the admin locks an NFT, ETH, or token in `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`, [a message is sent to `WinnablesTicketManager.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L186), which [sets the status of the raffle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L381) to `PRIZE_LOCKED`:
```solidity
        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;
```
If the admin decides to cancel the raffle, they can call `cancelRaffle` as long as the `RaffleStatus` is `PRIZE_LOCKED` or the raffle has ended:
```solidity
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    }
```

Since the `prizeManager` and `chainSelector` [are user inputs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) when calling `cancelRaffle` and aren't validated, and because anyone can call this function, a malicious user could potentially use malicious inputs for `prizeManager` and `chainSelector`. This could result in sending the CCIP message to the wrong `prizeManager` and changing the status of the raffle to `CANCELED`.
```solidity
@>  function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

@>      _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
@>      _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager,
            chainSelector,
            abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }

```

Given that the CCIP message was sent to the wrong `prizeManager`, the admin will not be able to withdraw the NFT, ETH, or token locked in `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`. Additionally, since the status of the raffle has been changed to `CANCELED`, it cannot be canceled again.

## Impact
Severe loss of funds, tokens, or NFTs.

## Recommendation
Do not use user inputs for structuring the CCIP message. Instead, use state variables that cannot be changed by unauthorized users
