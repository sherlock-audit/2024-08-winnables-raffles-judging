# Reentrancy attack possible in claimPrize() WinnablesPrizeManager contract

## Summary
The WinnablesPrizeManager contract manages raffles where prizes can be nfts, ERC20 tokens or ETH it also handles locking and distributing these prizes to winners. The contract includes functions for locking prizes and handling raffles across different chains using Chainlink CCIP. One important feature of this contract is the claimPrize function this function is public and its main goal is to send the prize for a Raffle to its rightful winner.

As you can see in the code snippet below this function check the type of the raffle and then send the prize to the winner if its NFT,token or ETH later on it checks whether the caller is rightful winner and mark the raffle as claimed.The first thing we note is that this function does not follow the CEI pattern since it checks for the winner after the prize is sent which will lead to a reentrancy attack if the raffle type is ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since we call the internal function _sendETHPrize which send the prize to the msg.sender when the raffle type is ETH, later on we mark this raffle as claimed note that this function isnt using any reentrancy guard so if the winner is a smart contract he can use this claimPrize function to drain all ETH locked in the contract.

This is a classic reentrancy attack because the function does not follow the CEI pattern which means we modify the state (rafflePrize.status) after the call is made(_sendETHPrize).

```solidity
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```


## Impact
A rightful winner can drain the WinnablesPrizeManager contract from all the ETH that is locked due to reentrancy in claimPrize() function.
