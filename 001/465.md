# `claimPrize` in `WinnablesPrizeManager` is prone to re-entrance attacks which can be abused by the winners of a raffle.

## Summary
`claimPrize` in `WinnablesPrizeManager` is prone to re-entrance attacks which can be abused by the winners of a raffle.

## Vulnerability Detail
Look at the`claimPrize` function:

```solidity
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```

When the RaffleType is ETH, `_sendETHPrize` is called:

```solidity
    function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
        (bool success, ) = winner.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
```

The problem is if the winner(msg.sender) is a smart contract, when it receives ETH, its fallback function can again call the `claimPrize` function, and keep draining the `WinnablesPrizeManager` of its `_ethLocked` until it becomes 0. This happens because the checks and updates to the `RafflePrizeStatus` status are made after the `_sendETHPrize` function is called, hence prone to re-entrance attacks.

`rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;` is set to CLAIMED after the `_sendETHPrize` function is called. Had it been done before `_sendETHPrize` function, it would not have been possible to carry these attacks. 

## Impact
High. Allows the winner of one raffle to eat into the ETH meant for other raffle winners, preventing other raffle winners from claiming their prize.
