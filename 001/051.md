# Malicious users can exploit raffle cancellation to disrupt protocol functionality

## Summary
Malicious users can exploit the `cancelRaffle` function to repeatedly cancel raffles, preventing new raffles from being created and disrupting ticket sales. This makes the protocol unusable by forcing admins to constantly lock new prizes and create new raffles.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle` function is designed to allow the cancellation of raffles under specific pre-conditions:
1. The raffle is not yet created, and its status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`, enabling admins to cancel raffles and unlock the prize in `WinnablesPrizeManager` in cases of misconfigured prizes.
2. The raffle period has ended, and the minimum ticket threshold has not been reached, allowing for refunds to users who purchased tickets.
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();

    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen(); 
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```
However, malicious users can repeatedly cancel raffles through `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle` by exploiting the first pre-condition. Specifically, after the `ccipReceive` function triggers and the prize is locked, the cancellation check passes, allowing the raffle to be canceled:
```solidity
function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
>>>    _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);
    _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
    // ...
}

function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
>>>    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    // ...
}
```
When a raffle is canceled, it cannot be created:
```solidity
function createRaffle(
    uint256 raffleId,
    uint64 startsAt,
    uint64 endsAt,
    uint32 minTickets,
    uint32 maxTickets,
    uint32 maxHoldings
) external onlyRole(0) {
    _checkRaffleTimings(startsAt, endsAt);
    if (maxTickets == 0) revert RaffleRequiresTicketSupplyCap();
    if (maxHoldings == 0) revert RaffleRequiresMaxHoldings();
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
>>>    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) revert PrizeNotLocked();

    // ...
}
```
As a result, admins are forced to lock new prizes in `WinnablePrizeManager` to create new raffles, but malicious users can continue to cancel these raffles immediately in `WinnablesTicketManagers` after the prize is locked, disrupting the protocol's functionality.

## Impact
Malicious users can repeatedly cancel raffles, preventing the creation of new raffles, stopping users from purchasing tickets, and forcing administrators to constantly create new raffles. This behavior renders the protocol unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the ability to cancel raffles when the status is `PRIZE_LOCKED` to admins only. Below is a suggested update to the `_checkShouldCancel` function:
```diff
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) {
+       _checkRole(msg.sender, 0);
    };
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();

    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen(); 
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```
