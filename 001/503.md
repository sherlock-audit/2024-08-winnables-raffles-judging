# The Winner can drain the `WinnablesPrizeManager` and steal all the ETH Locked In case of ETH Raffle.

### Summary

After the raffle has concluded and a winner is selected, the winner is supposed to call the `claimPrize` function to withdraw their ETH. However the status is update after the ETH has been sent to Receiver.


### Root Cause

The status of `rafflePrize` is updated after sending ETH to the receiver. Therefore, the receiver can re-enter the contract and drain the locked ETH and `PrizeManager` balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  There are `lockedETH` for other ETH Raffle or `PrizeManager` hold ETH.

### External pre-conditions

1. The  caller must be winner.

### Attack Path

1. Bob writes an attack contract and participates in an ETH raffle.
2. Bob wins the raffle in which he participated.
3. Bob calls the `claimPrize` function.
4. The `PrizeManager` sends ETH to Bob's contract, and Bob re-enters the contract to withdraw more ETH from `PrizeManager`.
5. Bob continues this process until there is no ETH left in the `PrizeManager`.


### Impact

The attacker will be able to drain the `PrizeManager` and withdraw all the ETH.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the state Before Interaction/Transfering the ETH.
