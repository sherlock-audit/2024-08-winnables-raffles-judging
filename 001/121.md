# WinnablesTicketManager.sol#refundPlayers - Malisious user can DoS the refund

## Summary
The `refundPlayers` sends all participations refund in for loop that allows a malisious user to revert the whole transaction and make the users unable to get their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a raffle is canceled there is a function to be called to refund the users' participation. It sends ETH to the users in a for loop that allows DoS.
```js
    function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId]; 
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length;) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
A user can make a contract with malisious code in his receive function to make the whole transaction to revert and other users unable to claim their funds.

## Impact
Users unable to claim their funds.

## Recommendation 

Make the function param only one user, not array and make it callable only by the user.
