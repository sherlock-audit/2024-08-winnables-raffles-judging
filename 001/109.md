# Permanent ETH Lock Due to Incorrect Handling of `_lockedETH` in Refund Function

## Summary
The contract's `_lockedETH` variable is not decremented when ETH refunds are issued, leading to potential denial of service or incorrect withdrawal amounts for the owner

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract uses a `_lockedETH` variable to track ETH locked in the contract that might be needed for future refunds. Each time a user buys a ticket, `_lockedETH` increases, and it decreases during the `propagateRaffleWinner` function. When the owner withdraws ETH from the contract, the contract checks to ensure that the owner is not withdrawing the locked ETH by comparing the contract balance against `_lockedETH`.

However, when a refund is issued, the `_lockedETH` variable is not reduced, leading to an incorrect calculation of available ETH for withdrawal. This discrepancy can result in a denial of service for the owner, preventing them from withdrawing ETH from the contract.

### Scenario 1:
1. Contract balance: 10 ETH
2. `_lockedETH`: 10 ETH
3. A refund of 1 ETH is issued
4. Contract balance: 9 ETH, `_lockedETH`: 10 ETH
5. The owner cannot withdraw ETH, resulting in a denial of service.

### Scenario 2:
1. Contract balance: 20 ETH
2. `_lockedETH`: 10 ETH
3. A refund of 1 ETH is issued
4. Contract balance: 19 ETH, `_lockedETH`: 10 ETH
5. The owner can only withdraw 9 ETH instead of the expected 10 ETH, leading to a financial discrepancy.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

```javascript
it('Should not be able to withdraw ETH after refund tickets', async () => {
    const contractBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(manager.address);
    const userBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(buyer2.address);
    const tx = await manager.refundPlayers(1, [buyer2.address]);
    const { events } = await tx.wait();
    expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(1);
    const [event] = events;
    expect(event.event).to.equal('PlayerRefund');
    const contractBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(manager.address);
    const userBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(buyer2.address);
    expect(contractBalanceAfter).to.eq(contractBalanceBefore.sub(100));
    expect(userBalanceAfter).to.eq(userBalanceBefore.add(100));
    await expect(manager.withdrawETH()).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
        manager,
        'ETHTransferFail'
    );
});
```

In the PoC above, after issuing a refund, the owner is unable to withdraw ETH from the contract due to incorrect handling of `_lockedETH`.

## Impact

This vulnerability results in a permanent lock of funds related to refunded ETH, preventing the owner from withdrawing the correct amount of ETH and potentially causing financial loss.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, update the `refundPlayers` function to properly reduce the `_lockedETH` variable when ETH is refunded.
