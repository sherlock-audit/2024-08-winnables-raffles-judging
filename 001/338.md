# WinnablesTicketManager.sol :: withdrawETH() if a raffle is canceled and refundPlayers() is called, not all the funds from the next ticket sales can be withdrawn, resulting in some of the funds being permanently stuck in the contract.

## Summary
**`withdrawETH()`** is used to withdraw ETH from a canceled raffle or ticket sales. The issue arises when a raffle is canceled, and **`refundPlayers()`** is called, but the **`_lockedETH`** variable is not updated. This result is some of the ETH from the next ticket sales being permanently stuck in the contract forever, unable to be withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`refundPlayers()`** is used to return the ETH spent on tickets for a raffle that has been canceled.
```Solidity
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
As you can see, the ETH is sent to the users, but the **`_lockedETH`** is not updated. This value represents all the ETH sent to the contract for purchased tickets. The issue becomes clear when examining **`withdrawETH()`**.
```Solidity
function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```
Earlier, we observed that when **`refundPlayers()`** is called, **`_lockedETH`** is not decreased, even though the contract's balance **`(address(this).balance)`** is reduced as ETH is sent back to users who purchased tickets. This causes an imbalance in the contract because **`_lockedETH`** is never updated for canceled raffles. 
As a result, not all ETH can be withdrawn from the contract since **`_lockedETH`** will never reach zero if even one raffle is canceled, preventing full withdrawal of ETH from the next ticket sales. Let’s go through an example to clarify this issue further.
- A raffle is created with each ticket priced at 1 ether.
- Bob and Alice each buy 1 ticket, bringing the **`contract balance`**, **`raffle.totalRaised`**, and **`_lockedETH`** to 2 ether.
- The raffle is canceled for some reason.
- **`refundPlayers()`** is called for Bob and Alice, reducing the **`contract balance`** to 0 ether, but **`_lockedETH`** remains at 2 ether.
- A new raffle is created, again with each ticket priced at 1 ether.
- Carl buys 5 tickets, raising the **`contract balance`** to 5 ether, **`raffle.totalRaised`** to 5 ether, and **`_lockedETH`** to 7 ether (2 ether from the canceled raffle and 5 from the current raffle).
- The raffle concludes, and the admin wants to withdraw the profits. When [propagateRaffleWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L343) is called, **`_lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised`** is calculated to release the ticket sales profits. However, **`_lockedETH`** is 7 ether, and **`raffle.totalRaised`** is 5 ether, so **`_lockedETH`** becomes 2 ether (the amount from the canceled raffle).
- The admin then calls **`withdrawETH()`**. The contract balance is 5 ether, but **`_lockedETH`** is 2 ether, so the withdrawable balance is **`address(this).balance - _lockedETH = 5 - 2 = 3 ether`**. The admin can only withdraw 3 ether instead of 5, leaving 2 ether stuck in the contract forever.
## POC
To see the problem copy the following POC in **`TicketManager.sol`** inside **`describe('Cancellation with tickets threshold not reached')`**.
```js
it('Not all the benefits can be withdrawn', async () => {
      await (await link.mint(manager.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'))).wait();

      //locktokens
      await (await manager.setCCIPCounterpart(counterpartContractAddress, 1, true)).wait();
      await whileImpersonating(ccipRouter.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>
      manager.connect(signer).ccipReceive({
        messageId: ethers.constants.HashZero,
        sourceChainSelector: 1,
        sender: '0x' + counterpartContractAddress.slice(-40).padStart(64, '0'),
        data: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001',
        destTokenAmounts: []
      })
    );
    
    //crate raffle
      const now = await blockTime();
      await manager.createRaffle(
        1,
        now,
        now + timeSeconds.hour,
        50,
        500,
        10
      );

      //buy tickets
      buyer2 = await getWalletWithEthers();
      const currentBlock = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
      const sig = await api.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint16', 'uint256', 'uint256'], [
          buyer2.address,
          0,
          1,
          10,
          currentBlock + 10,
          100
        ])
      ));

      await manager.connect(buyer2).buyTickets(1, 10, currentBlock + 10, sig, { value: 100 })

      //cancel raffle and refund user
      await helpers.time.increase(timeSeconds.hour);
      await manager.cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1);
      await manager.refundPlayers(1, [buyer2.address]);
      
      //lock tokens for the raffle2
      await whileImpersonating(ccipRouter.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>
      manager.connect(signer).ccipReceive({
        messageId: ethers.constants.HashZero,
        sourceChainSelector: 1,
        sender: '0x' + counterpartContractAddress.slice(-40).padStart(64, '0'),
        data: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002',
        destTokenAmounts: []
      })
      
    );

    //create raffle2
    const now2 = await blockTime();
      await manager.createRaffle(
        2,
        now2,
        now2 + timeSeconds.hour,
        5,
        500,
        10
      );

    //buy tickets for raffle2
    buyer1 = await getWalletWithEthers();
      const currentBlock2 = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
      const sig2 = await api.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint16', 'uint256', 'uint256'], [
          buyer1.address,
          0,
          2, //raffleid
          10, //ticket count
          currentBlock2 + 10,
          500 //price
        ])
      ));

      await manager.connect(buyer1).buyTickets(2, 10, currentBlock2 + 10, sig2, { value: 500 })

      //pick a winner
      await helpers.time.increase(timeSeconds.hour);
      await manager.drawWinner(2);
      await (await coordinator.fulfillRandomWordsWithOverride(1, manager.address, [randomWord()])).wait();
      await manager.propagateRaffleWinner(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 2)

      //withdraw the benefits
      await manager.withdrawETH();
      const contractBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(manager.address);
      //The balance is not zero because _lockedETH is 100 from the canceled first raffle. 
      //Therefore only 400 can be withdrawn, address(this).balance - _lockedETH = 500 - 100 = 400, resultingin 100 funds being locked in the contract indefinitely.
      expect(contractBalance).to.eq(100);
    });
```
As you can see, the contract balance should be zero, but that’s not the case.
## Impact
Not all the ETH from ticket sales can be withdrawn, leaving some funds permanently stuck in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, subtract the refunded ETH from **`_lockedETH`** when **`refundPlayers()`** is called.
```diff
function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
+           _lockedETH -= amountToSend ;
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
