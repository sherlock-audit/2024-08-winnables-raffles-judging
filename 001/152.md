# Malicious Actor Can Exploit Reentrancy Vulnerability to Drain Funds from WinnablesPrizeManager Contract

### Summary

The `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability arises because the function makes external calls to transfer ETH (or other assets) before updating its internal state to mark the prize as claimed. As a result, a malicious actor can exploit this by repeatedly calling `claimPrize` before the internal state is updated, potentially draining the contract’s funds.

### Root Cause

1. External Calls Before State Updates: The function performs external calls to transfer ETH before it updates the internal state to mark the prize as claimed. This allows an attacker to exploit the timing gap between when the external call is made and when the internal state is updated.

2. Lack of Reentrancy Protection: The function does not include mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks, such as reentrancy guards. This means that an attacker can re-enter the function before it has finished its execution, taking advantage of the fact that the prize status has not yet been updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Deploy Malicious Contract

* The attacker creates a contract with a fallback function designed to re-enter the claimPrize function.

2. Participate and Win

* The attacker participates in the raffle and wins, becoming eligible to claim the prize.

3. Claim Prize

* The attacker calls claimPrize, which initiates the prize transfer but has not yet updated the prize status.

4.  Reentrancy Exploitation

* During the ETH transfer, the malicious contract’s fallback function triggers additional calls to claimPrize.

5. Drain Funds

* The attacker’s contract drains the ETH from the raffle contract by exploiting the fact that the prize status has not yet been set to CLAIMED.

### Impact

The primary impact is the potential financial loss for the contract owner or users. An attacker can drain all ETH or other assets from the raffle contract, leading to significant financial damage.

### Mitigation

* Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern: This pattern involves performing all necessary checks, updating the contract’s state, and only then making external calls. This reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.

* Implement Reentrancy Guard: Use reentrancy guards to prevent reentrant calls. OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` provides a straightforward way to add this protection
