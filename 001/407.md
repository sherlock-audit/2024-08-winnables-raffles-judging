# Winners Can Be Griefed Of Their Deserving Prizes

## Summary

The admin is supposed to be 100% trusted BUT only has one exception , "Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize" from the README . But turns out there exists a case where this can be done

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) After the entire raffle has been completed the ticket manager contract would send a message to the prize manager contract telling who is the winner , https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L340

2.) Prize manager receives the above message and updates the winner address

3.) Now the winner is entitles to the rewards and will be claiming the prize via the `claimPrize()` function  , but the admin doesnt like this outcome and ,

4.) Before the winner could call claimPrize() (via frontrunning), sets his malicious counterpart address which is in the admin's control

5.) Then sends a message from the malicious counterpart to the prize manager with a RAFFLE_CANCELED message , since there are no
checks to see if the winner has already been declared, the function would mark the raffle as cancelled and cancel the raffle ->

6.) Now the raffle status is CANCELLED , and most importantly (lets for example assume the prize locked was a NFT) the NFT has been unlocked here ->

7.) And the admin now calls `withdrawNFT()` and since NFT has been unlocked the admin would receive the NFT

8.) Most importantly , now the winner can't claim his prize NFT (when the claimPrize executes) since it has been already sent to the admin , the admin has successfully griefed the winner to not get his deserving prize.

## Impact

The admin has successfully griefed the winner and the winner now would not receive his deserving prize .
