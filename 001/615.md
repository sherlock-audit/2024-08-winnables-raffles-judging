# Reentrancy in claimPrize() allows malicious winner to steal ETH

## Summary

Winner can reenter claimPrize() function to steal more ETH. This means that other ongoing raffles would lose ETH that was locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Winner (i.e. a malicious contract implementation) calls function claimPrize() to claim the ETH tokens received as reward for winning raffle
2. The malicious contract calls function claimPrize() in its fallback/receive function when an external call is made to it using function _sendETH().
3. Since the CLAIMED status has not been updated, the call continues decreasing the ethLocked variable and thus allowing the attacker to continuously steal ETH.
