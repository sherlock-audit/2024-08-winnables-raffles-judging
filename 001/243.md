# WinnablesTicketManager.sol#cancelRaffle - A user can DoS raffle creation

## Summary
A user can DoS raffle creation by always front-running raffle creation by calling `cancelRaffle` making it impossible for a raffle to be created.
## Vulnerability Detail
An admin first sends reward inside `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`, the next step is to choose if the raffle will be created with `createRaffle` or canceled with `cancelRaffle`. The admin should decide what to do with the raffle and call the correspond function. 

`cancelRaffle` can also be called for another reason - if the raffle doesn't sell enough tickets to refund users
```js
 function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```
Inside `_checkShouldCancel` function there are a few checks to ensure the raffle can be canceled.  
```js
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return; 
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle(); 
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen(); 
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }

```
The users **SHOULD** be able to cancel a raffle **ONLY** if it doesn't sell enough tickets. Only admins should be able to choose if a raffle to be created or canceled. But if we pay more attention to the first if, if it is true, the function will return, and none of the above if checks will be checked allowing anyone to cancel a raffle. 
```js
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return; 
```
Because of that a user can DoS raffle creation by always front-running raffle creation by calling `cancelRaffle` making it impossible for a raffle to be created.

## Impact
DoS on raffle creation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the raffle status is PRIZE_LOCKED, add a check to ensure that the admin calls the function and then return, if not the admin - revert.
