# If a refund has occurred, the owner will not be able to withdraw the full proceeds from the raffle.

### Summary

When refunding ticket, `_lockedETH` is not reduced, resulting in `_lockedETH` being larger than it should be, which means the owner can withdraw less than the intended amount.

### Root Cause

The `_lockedETH` in `WinnablesTicketManager`[ increases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L206) during `buyTickets` and only [decreases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L343) in `propagateRaffleWinner`, but it does not decrease during [cancel and refund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L215-L228).

This causes `_lockedETH` to be larger than the actual balance, for example:
1. The user spends 100 ETH to execute `buyTickets`, at which point `balance == 100 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
2. The raffle is canceled, so 100 ETH is refunded to the user, but `_lockedETH` is not decreased, at which point `balance == 0 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
3. The user spends another 50 ETH to execute `buyTickets` for a new raffle, at which point `balance == 50 ETH, _lockedETH == 150 ETH`.
4. The raffle is completed normally, and `propagateRaffleWinner` reduces `_lockedETH` by 50 ETH, at which point `balance == 50 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
5. Originally, the 50 ETH in the balance was the profit that the owner could obtain, but since `balance - _lockedETH` would underflow, this portion of the profit cannot be withdrawn.

### Attack Path

1. The user spends 100 ETH to execute `buyTickets`, at which point `balance == 100 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
2. The raffle is canceled, so 100 ETH is refunded to the user, but `_lockedETH` is not decreased, at which point `balance == 0 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
3. The user spends another 50 ETH to execute `buyTickets` for a new raffle, at which point `balance == 50 ETH, _lockedETH == 150 ETH`.
4. The raffle is completed normally, and `propagateRaffleWinner` reduces `_lockedETH` by 50 ETH, at which point `balance == 50 ETH, _lockedETH == 100 ETH`.
5. Originally, the 50 ETH in the balance was the profit that the owner could obtain, but since `balance - _lockedETH` would underflow, this portion of the profit cannot be withdrawn.

### Impact

The protocol cannot withdraw the raffle proceeds in full, and these assets will be locked in the contract forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decrease `_lockedETH` in `refundPlayers`.
