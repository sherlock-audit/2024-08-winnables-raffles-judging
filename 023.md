# Improper Allowance Handling Leading to Transaction Reverts with Certain Tokens

## Summary
The contract's constructor sets an allowance for the LINK token without first resetting it to zero. This can cause transactions to revert when interacting with tokens that require the allowance to be set to zero before being updated to a new value, such as USDT.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor of the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract, the following line sets the allowance for the LINK token directly to the maximum value:
`LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, type(uint256).max);`
Example Case:
1. Initial Condition:
Suppose the current allowance of LINK_TOKEN for _ccipRouter is 100.
2. Transaction:
The contract tries to set the allowance to `type(uint256).max` directly:
`LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, type(uint256).max);`
3. Result:
Since tokens like USDT do not allow a direct change from 100 to type(uint256).max without first setting it to zero, the transaction will fail (revert).

## Impact
If the contract interacts with tokens that enforce this allowance mechanism, the constructor will fail, causing the deployment of the contract to revert. This can prevent the contract from being deployed or cause issues during interactions with these tokens, leading to potential loss of functionality or funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The allowance must be set to zero before setting it to the desired value.
```solidity
constructor(
    address _linkToken,
    address _ccipRouter
)
BaseCCIPContract(_ccipRouter) BaseLinkConsumer(_linkToken) {
    _setRole(msg.sender, 0, true); // Deployer is admin by default
    LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, 0); // Set approval to zero first
    LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN).approve(_ccipRouter, type(uint256).max); // Then set to maximum
}
```
