# `WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle` lacks access control, can result DoS and LINK token loss

### Summary

The ticket manager contract does not have access control on the [`cancelRaffle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) function, this allows any address to call such function, and can cause some degrees of DoS, also combining with loss of LINK tokens.

### Root Cause

As we can see, that `cancelRaffle` does not have a `checkRole` modifier, while other similar functions in the contract do:

```solidity
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
 // ... 
    function createRaffle(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint64 startsAt,
        uint64 endsAt,
        uint32 minTickets,
        uint32 maxTickets,
        uint32 maxHoldings
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
```

### Attack Path

A malicious user can observe that whenever the raffle has the `PRIZE_LOCKED` status, and has enough tickets supply, call the function, and to cancel the raffle, causing DoS. Moreover, as the cancellation message is sent cross chain, so it would consume LINK tokens, and according to README file, LINK tokens are supplied by protocol admins:

> Admins will always keep LINK in the contracts (to pay for CCIP Measages) and in the VRF subscription (to pay for the random numbers)

### Impact

There are two major impacts on this issue: the first being raffles can constantly denied, but since users can always get refund, and locked prize can also get unlocked, so no funds at any risks. The second one is as previously mentioned, that cross chain messages would consume LINK tokens, which are provided by admins, a malicious user who intentionally cancel raffles would cost little to none to make a loss of LINK tokens. Based on the latter impact, and the low cost, I would say this is high severity.
