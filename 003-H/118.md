# Raffles can be instantly cancelled by anyone as soon as they are created

### Summary

Incorrect validation in `_checkShouldCancel` will cause anyone to be able to cancel a raffle as soon as they are created.

### Root Cause

Let us examine the `_checkShouldCancel` function:

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return; // @audit this will successfully cancel a raffle
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```

When a raffle is created, the admin has to lock the prize on the Ethereum Mainnet first, then send a CCIP message to Avalanche. Once the Avalanche side receives the info, the raffle is marked as `PRIZE_LOCKED`, after which the admin can create the raffle.

However, as shown above, a raffle is cancellable when the status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`. Then anyone can just cancel the raffle before it is created, preventing any raffle from taking place at all.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Anyone can cancel a raffle before it is created, bricking the protocol entirely.

### Mitigation

Cancelling on `PRIZE_LOCKED` should only be possible by the admin, when the raffle has not started yet.
