# `cancelRaffle` function can be used to grief protocol

## Summary
`cancelRaffle` function has no access control, can be called by a griefer to keep interrupting raffle process.
## Vulnerability Detail
After a prize is locked in prize manager, a CCIP message is sent to ticket manager which sets the raffle status to PRIZE_LOCKED in ticket manager. At this point anyone can call `cancelRaffle` to reset the raffle process, wasting Link tokens of the protocol. Because of the extra Link tokens spent, the losses protocol incur will be greater than the attacker's.

## Impact
Raffle creation can be griefed, the imbalance in costs will damage protocol more than the attacker.
