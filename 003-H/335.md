# Attacker can DOS the creation of Raffles by exploiting the cancellation function

### Summary

The incorrect handling of the PRIZE_LOCKED state in the _checkShouldCancel function will cause a Denial of Service (DOS) attack for the Winnables protocol as malicious users will repeatedly cancel raffles immediately after prizes are locked, preventing legitimate raffle creation.

### Root Cause

In [WinnablesTicketManager:cancelRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L278) there is no access control meaning anyone can call it.

Then in [WinnablesTicketManager:_checkShouldCancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L436)
the function immediately returns without reverting if the raffle status is PRIZE_LOCKED.

This combination allows any user to cancel a raffle that is in the PRIZE_LOCKED state, which occurs after the prize is locked but before the raffle is fully created, inside the [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L381) function of TicketManager

### Internal pre-conditions

1) Admin needs to lock a prize in WinnablesPrizeManager in Mainnet (this will send a corresponde CCIP Message to Avalanche WinnablesTicketManager)

### External pre-conditions

1) Chainlink CCIP needs to successfully send the message from Ethereum to Avalanche when creating the Raffle. It is trigged in:
[lockNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L163)
[lockETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L186)
[lockTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L211)
2) TicketManager on Avalanche needs to correctly receive the CCIP message and set the Raffle status to PRIZE_LOCKED.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the Winnables protocol for new prize being lock in Ethereum
2. When a new raffle is created, the attacker waits for the Chainlink CCIP message to be sent to Avalanche.
3. As soon as the CCIP message is received and the raffle status is set to PRIZE_LOCKED on Avalanche and emits a event RafflePrizeLocked(), the attacker calls cancelRaffle(prizeManager, chainSelector, raffleId) function.
4. The _checkShouldCancel function allows the cancellation to proceed due to the PRIZE_LOCKED state.
5. The raffle is cancelled, and a CCIP message is sent back to Ethereum to unlock the prize.
6. The attacker repeats steps 1-5 for each new raffle, effectively preventing any raffle from being fully created.

### Impact

The Winnables protocol suffers a loss of functionality and cannot successfully create new raffles. The protocol also incurs unnecessary gas costs for each attempted prize Lock in mainnet and cancellation cycle. The attacker loses the gas fees on Avalanche for calling the cancelRaffle function but gains the ability to deny service to the protocol (griefing attack).

### PoC

Add this test in TicketManager.js

```javascript
  describe('Cancellation before raffle creation can be called by anyone', () => {
    before(async () => {
      snapshot = await helpers.takeSnapshot();
    });

    after(async () => {
      await snapshot.restore();
    });

    it('Anyone can cancel the raffle', async () => {
      await (await link.mint(manager.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'))).wait();
      const nonAdmin = signers[1];
      const tx = await manager.connect(nonAdmin).cancelRaffle(counterpartContractAddress, 1, 1);
      const { events } = await tx.wait();
      expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(3);
      const ccipMessageEvent = ccipRouter.interface.parseLog(events[0]);
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.name).to.eq('MockCCIPMessageEvent');
      expect(ccipMessageEvent.args.data).to.eq('0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001');
    });
  })
```

### Mitigation

Option 1: Restrict cancelRaffle to admin only
```solidity
cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external onlyRole(0) {
    // ... existing function body ...
}
```
Option 2: Allow everyone to call cancelRaffle, but implement additional checks
If the protocol decides to keep the cancelRaffle function open to all users, the following additional measures should be considered:

Modify the _checkShouldCancel function to explicitly handle all raffle states:
```solidity
_checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) revert CannotCancelLockedRaffle();
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```

Or add a new variable in the Raffle struct *lockedAt* which is set in _ccipReceive to block.timestamp
Implement a time delay between prize locking and allowing cancellation:
(raffle.lockedAt + CANCELLATION_DELAY > block.timestamp) revert CancellationTooEarly();


Recommendation:
Option 1 (admin-only cancellation) provides the highest level of security and control. It prevents any potential abuse of the cancellation mechanism by unauthorized parties.
However, if the protocol design requires allowing public cancellation for specific reasons (e.g., to enable automated processes or to allow participants to cancel under certain conditions), then Option 2 with the additional checks and safeguards should be implemented.
The choice between these options depends on the specific requirements and design philosophy of the Winnables protocol. If there's no strong reason to allow public cancellation, Option 1 is the safer choice. If public cancellation is a desired feature, Option 2 with robust checks can mitigate the risks while maintaining the open functionality.
