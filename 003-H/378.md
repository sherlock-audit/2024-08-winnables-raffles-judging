# Attacker Can Cancel The Raffle By FrontRunning A Create Raffle Call

## Summary

Attacker can grief every raffle creation and cancel it making it impossible for the admin to create any new raffles.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Ticket manager receives  CCIP message via _ccipReceive() -> this sets the prize to locked i.e. _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;

2.) Then the admin calls createRaffle() which checks if the status is PRIZE_LOCKED

3.) The attacker front runs the above transaction with a call to cancelRaffle() -> since status is PRIZE_LOCKED the check at _checkShouldCancel passes 
and raffle status is set to CANCELLED

4.) Now when the admin's createRaffle() tx finally executes , it reverts since status is CANCELLED (and it requires status to be PRIZE_LOCKED)

5.) Therefore , every raffle can be griefed this way and never be created

## Impact

Attacker can grief every raffle creation and cancel it making it impossible for the admin to create any new raffles.
The core system logic will be griefed.
