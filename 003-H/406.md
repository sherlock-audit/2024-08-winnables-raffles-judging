# `External` function `cancelRaffle` in `WinnablesTicketManager` contract can be called by anyone, leading to severe damage to core functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract is responsible for creating raffles with a specific raffle ID, which ID is sent to the contract via CCIP. In order for a user to participate in a raffle, they should buy tickets for the specific raffle. This is done via the `buyTickets` function. However if the time runs out and the minimum number of tickets wasnâ€™t reached, it becomes possible to cancel the raffle. Let's have a deeper look into `cancelRaffle` function:

```javascript
    function cancelRaffle(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        _checkShouldCancel(raffleId);

        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
        _sendCCIPMessage(
            prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
        );
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

The function `cancelRaffle` is `external`, which can be called by anyone. Inside it calls the `_checkShouldCancel` function, which checks if the raffle should be canceled. Here comes the issue:

```javascript
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
@>      if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```

The `raffle.status` is set to `PRIZE_LOCKED`, when the admin locks a prize for the raffle. This is done by calling either `lockNFT`, `lockETH` or `lockTokens` in `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract and the raffle ID is sent to `WinnablesTicketManager` via CCIP. In that case, when a user calls `cancelRaffle`, the `_checkShouldCancel` function will always return, because of the first if-statement, and exit the function:

```javascript
if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
```

This means that a malicious user can track when a raffle is created, and call the `cancelRaffle` function to cancel the raffle. This can cause 2 serious functionality issues:
1. Every raffle ID will be canceled and the admin will not be able to create a raffle.
2. `cancelRaffle` function sends a message throught CCIP, which is done by paying a certain amount of LINK tokens. In that case, the user spends LINK tokens from the contract.

## Impact
Core functionality of the protocol (creating raffles) can be severely damaged, and funds can be forcefully spent from the contract (LINK tokens).

## Recommendation
When the status of a raffle is `PRIZE_LOCKED`, it means that the admin can create a raffle with the specific raffle ID. When the status of the raffle is `IDLE`, it means that the raffle is created and users can buy tickets to participate in the raffle. Consider removing the first if-statement in `_checkShouldCancel`, which canceles when status is `PRIZE_LOCKED`.

```diff
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
-       if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```

If the admin wants to make the status from `PRIZE_LOCKED` to `CANCELED` for some reason, consider creating a function, which changes the status, and can be called only by the admin. For example:

```javascript
    function setCancelState(uint256 raffleId) external onlyRole(0) {
        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
    }
```
