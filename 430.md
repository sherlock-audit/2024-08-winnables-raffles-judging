# `WinnablesTicket.sol::balanceOfBatch` could Revert due to out-of-gas when the array size is large

## Summary
The function `balanceOfBatch` in `WinnablesTicket.sol` contract takes arrays of `accounts` and `id` but no check for array length so when the array becomes large, calling this function could revert due to out of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `balanceOfBatch` in `WinnablesTicket.sol` contract getting arrays of `accounts` and `id` and storing accounts.length into `batchBalances` array and iterates over `accounts.length` to get balance and It does not impose any limits on the size of these arrays. so when an attacker exploit this function by sending large arrays of `address` and `ids` to the `balanceOfBatch` function `accounts.length`  will become large and the function will revert due to out of gas whenever its called

## Impact

This vulnerability disrupts balance-checking functionality across the application, affecting any frontend or backend components that rely on this function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a maximum limit on the length of accounts and ids arrays to prevent excessively large inputs.
```solidity
require(accounts.length <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Array too long");
```
