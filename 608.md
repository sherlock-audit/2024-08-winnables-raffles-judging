# The implementation of _packCCIPContract and _ccipReceive allows message receiving from chains with same chain id where one might not be configured.

## Summary
The implementation of `_packCCIPContract` and `_ccipReceive` allows message receiving from chains with same chain id where one might not be configured. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Look at the following code:

```solidity
   function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
        (uint256 raffleId) = abi.decode(message.data, (uint256));
        if (_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE) {
            // The raffle cannot be created, send back a cancel message to unlock the prize
            _sendCCIPMessage(
                _senderAddress,
                message.sourceChainSelector,
                abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
            );
            return;
        }
        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;

        emit RafflePrizeLocked(
            message.messageId,
            message.sourceChainSelector,
            raffleId
        );
    }
   ```
   
   ccip receive function checks if the packed address+chain id have been setup to receive message and than execute core functionality depending upon the message. 
   
But the problem with that is if let's say BOB chain is configured with chain id 69, and there is an Alice chain out there with same id, it will allow message receiving from both chain where on one chain the address can be controlled by different entity and they can than make atatck calls. 

This have happened in the past where two different chains have same chain id for some time. 

The dao hard fork:

Initially, both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) shared the same chain ID, which was 1. This overlap created the potential for replay attacks, where a transaction signed on one chain could be replayed on the other chain. To mitigate this, Ethereum Classic later changed its chain ID to 61 to distinguish itself from the Ethereum mainnet.

BSC and Heuco chain shared the same chain id at one point too.

## Impact
Arbitrary call will succeed from a blockchain with same chain id.

## Recommendation
Don't use chain id as source of truth only.
