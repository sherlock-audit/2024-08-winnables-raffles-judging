The unchecked keyword is used in multiple places to bypass overflow checks in arithmetic operations. 

```solidity
unchecked { _tokensLocked[tokenInfo.tokenAddress] -= tokenInfo.amount; }
unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
```
If an overflow occurs in these operations, it could lead to incorrect balances being recorded, causing the contract to either lock more tokens or ETH than it actually has, or allowing withdrawals of more than what should be possible.



### Root Cause

Unchecked is unreliable

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If an overflow occurs in these operations, it could lead to incorrect balances being recorded, causing the contract to either lock more tokens or ETH than it actually has, or allowing withdrawals of more than what should be possible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the unchecked keyword and allow the default Solidity overflow checks to occur.
