# isContract() check is invalid due to solidity version incompatibility

### Summary

The isContract() function imported from Address library only supports solidity 0.8.1, does not support solidity 0.8.24 that is relied in the WinnablesTicket contract, thus rendering the isContract() check in the _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck() function invalid.

### Root Cause

The Openzepplin Address Library has upgraded many times along with the solidity version upgrade. 

Only Address Library supporting solidity 0.8.0 or older version contains isContract()  function, the latest Address library does not contain  isContract()  function.

### Mitigation

 Create a new isContract(address account) function to check the address as following, this could avoid the solidity version issues: 

  function isContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(account) // Get the size of the code at the address
        }
        return size > 0; // Return true if size is greater than 0, indicating it's a contract
    }
