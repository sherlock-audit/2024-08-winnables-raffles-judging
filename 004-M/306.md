# Incorrect handling of status parameter in `_setRole` leads to unauthorized role escalation

### Summary

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `_setRole` function always sets the role to `true`, regardless of the status parameter. This will cause unauthorized role escalation for the contract and its users as a malicious actor with role 0 will be able to grant roles even when attempting to revoke them by calling `_setRole(user, role, false)`.

### Root Cause

In `Roles.sol` the [_setRole:31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L31) function, the root cause is the incorrect handling of the `status` parameter, which always sets the role to `true` regardless of the `status` value.

Instances where `_setRole` is called:

- [instance 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L53)

- [instance 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L38)

- [instance 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L63)


### Internal pre-conditions

 1. `Role 0 needs to call _setRole to set _addressRoles[user] to be set, regardless of the status parameter`.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. `Role 0` calls `_setRole(user, role, false)` intending to revoke the role from user.

2. The `_setRole` function incorrectly sets the role to `true` due to the flawed handling of the status parameter.

3. As a result, `user` retains or gains the role that was intended to be revoked, leading to unauthorized role escalation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of control over role-based permissions. The attacker gains unauthorized access to roles that were intended to be revoked, potentially leading to financial losses and compromised protocol operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`_setRole` function should be corrected to properly handle the `status`  parameter. This ensures that roles are correctly `set or unset based on the intended action`.
