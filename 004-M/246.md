# Roles._setRole() cannot delete a role from a user.

### Summary

Roles._setRole() cannot delete a role from a user since it has not used the argument ```status```.

### Root Cause

The argument ```status``` is never used. The function does not implement the case of deleting a role from a user.

### Attack Path

When an admin wants to delete a role from the user, it will always fail.

### Impact

A user can authorize the purchase of raffles, and after he was caught cheating, the admin likes to delete his role, but such a role cannot be deleted from the user. The privige he has cannot be taken away.

### PoC

A user has a role 1, then the admin cannot take his role away.

### Mitigation

Use the ```status``` to decide to add/delete a role from user.
