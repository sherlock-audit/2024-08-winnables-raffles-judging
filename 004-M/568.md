# Incorrect Role Assignment Logic Will Mismanage User Roles

### Summary

The __setRole_ function in the **Roles** contract has a logic error where it always sets the role regardless of the status parameter. This incorrect implementation results in the function not properly handling the role status update, leading to potential incorrect role assignments. The intended behavior of setting or unsetting a role based on the _status_ parameter is not being achieved.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29

### Root Cause

The __setRole_ function is designed to set or unset a role for a user. The logic intended to update the user's roles based on the _status_ parameter is incorrect:


- Setting Role: If _status_ is _true_, the role should be set.
- Unsetting Role: If _status_ is _false_, the role should be unset.

However, the current implementation:

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

Always sets the role regardless of the status parameter. This is because the bitwise OR operation roles | (1 << role) is used unconditionally, which means the role bit is always set to 1, effectively ignoring the status parameter.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A valid _user_ address must be provided.
2. The _role_ must be within the range of valid roles (0 to 255).

### External pre-conditions

1. The _setRole_ function requires the caller to have the appropriate role (role 0 in this case) to invoke the __setRole_ function.

### Attack Path

1. An external caller invokes _setRole_ with a _user_, _role_, and _status_.
2. The _setRole_ function calls __setRole_, which does not properly handle the _status_ parameter.
3. Roles are always set to _true_ for the specified role regardless of the _status_ parameter, which could lead to unauthorized or incorrect role assignments.

### Impact

The incorrect role assignment logic in __setRole_ can have several adverse effects:

- **Unauthorized Role Assignments**: Users might receive roles they should not have if _status_ is meant to unset the role.
- **Security Risks**: Users might gain unintended permissions if the role is always set, even when it should be removed.
- **Operational Issues**: The intended role management and permissions system will not function as expected, potentially causing inconsistencies in access control.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (status) {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // Set the role
    } else {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role)); // Unset the role
    }
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
