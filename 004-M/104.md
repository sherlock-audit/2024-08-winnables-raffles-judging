# Roles that are already set cannot be removed

## Summary
In `Roles.sol::_setRole` when a role is already set it cannot be removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Roles.sol::_setRole` uses Bitwise OR to set the bit corresponding to a role. This is problematic because there is no way to remove the the already set role due to the way that Bitwise OR works https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-or-operator-in-programming/#what-is-bitwise-or .
Example: 
1. We don't have any role (0000)
2. We set the 2nd role  (0100), counting from right to left
3. This role (0100) cannot be removed because of the way Bitwise OR works
	-  Bitwise OR always return 1 if one of the two inputs is 1
4. Role stays 0100 no matter what you do

## Impact
Once a role is set it cannot be removed

## Code Snippet

```jsx

function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {

uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);

@> _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));

emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);

}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use XOR instead of OR when setting the role. This will allow the `_setRole` function to set and remove roles.
