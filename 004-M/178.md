### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

From the contest's `README`

>Role 0 is an admin role and it allows its members to grant or deny roles to other users. That role is granted to the deployer in the constructor.

But `Roles#_setRole` is missing implementation for denying roles to other users.

### Impact

Admin can not deny roles to other users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement denying roles in `Roles#_setRole` basing on the `status` input argument

```diff
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
-	_addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
+	_addressRoles[user] = status ? bytes32(roles | (1 << role)) : bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
