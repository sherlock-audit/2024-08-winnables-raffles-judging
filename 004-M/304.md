# Inability to Revoke Roles Leading to Permanent Privilege Escalation Risk

## Summary

The current implementation of the role management system in the `Roles.sol` contract lacks the ability to revoke roles once they have been granted. This oversight allows roles to be permanently assigned, which poses a significant security risk, particularly if a privileged address (such as an admin) becomes compromised.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_setRole` function, responsible for assigning and managing roles, only grants roles but does not correctly handle the revocation of roles. Specifically, the `status` parameter intended to allow both setting and unsetting roles is not utilized effectively, leading to a scenario where a role, once assigned, cannot be removed. This could result in addresses retaining elevated privileges indefinitely, even if those addresses are no longer trusted or have been compromised.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to **permanent privilege escalation**. If an address with critical roles (such as an admin) is compromised, the attacker will retain control indefinitely, as there is no mechanism to revoke the compromised role. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive functions, unauthorized changes to other users' roles, or other malicious activities, potentially leading to the full compromise of the contract.

## Code Snippet

The following snippet illustrates the issue within the `_setRole` function in `Roles.sol`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L33

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // Only sets the role, doesn't revoke
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_setRole` function to properly handle the `status` parameter, allowing roles to be both granted and revoked. The updated function should set the role when `status` is `true` and clear (revoke) the role when `status` is `false`. Here's the recommended code modification:

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);

    if (status) {
        // Grant role: Set the corresponding bit to 1
        roles |= (1 << role);
    } else {
        // Revoke role: Set the corresponding bit to 0
        roles &= ~(1 << role);
    }

    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles);
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

This change will ensure that roles can be dynamically managed, reducing the risk of permanent privilege escalation and improving the overall security of the contract.
