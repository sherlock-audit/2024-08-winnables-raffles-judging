# Roles can't be revoked

### Summary

In the ``Roles.sol`` contract, new roles can be set by the [setRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L35-L37) function which internally calls the [_setRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L33) function. There is no specific function for revoking a role and trying to revoke a role via the [_setRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L29-L33) function won't work, no matter what the input for the **role** parameter is. 

```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```

### Root Cause
There is no functionality to revoke a role.
```solidity
_addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
```
The use of the **OR** bitwise operator can only add new roles.

### Internal pre-conditions
 - An admin gives an address the minter role (role 1)
 - Address gets compromised, or the admin decides that this person shouldn't be allowed to mint NFTs anymore by calling the [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182-L199) function.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If an address which has role 1 (a role which can mint NFTs) gets compromised, the role can't be removed, and the compromised address can continue minting NFTs to himself for free (not a single role can't be revoked) . Given the fact that the whole purpose of the ``Roles.sol`` contract is to assign and remove roles, missing such an important functionality may have a severe impact, thus the Medium severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use well known and battle tested libraries for role management, such as Openzeppelin, or add the required functionality to revoke a role.
