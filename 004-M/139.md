# Malicious admin will not be able to have their admin role removed, compromising protocol as a whole

### Summary

`Roles::_setRole` always sets the role bit to 1, regardless of the `status` parameter. This means that once an admin role (role 0) is granted, it cannot be revoked, creating a significant security risk if an admin account is compromised.

### Root Cause

[Roles.sol#L31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/Roles.sol#L31)

```javascript
// Roles.sol:31
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
@>  _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

This function always sets the role bit to 1 using the bitwise OR operation, regardless of the `status` parameter. As a result, once a role is granted, it cannot be revoked.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin role (`_setRole(adminAddress, 0, true)`) needs to be set up for a desired address (e.g. `0x123...`), amongst other admins

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Aforementioned admin goes rogue, being able to infinitely harm the protocol and prevent all funds from leaving the system (by manipulating CCIP/VRF params) and/or stealing funds from the protocol via `withdraw`
2. Other admins are unable to revoke rogue admin's role

### Impact

- Unauthorized actions can be performed indefinitely (e.g. `WinnablesTicketManager`'s `withdrawETH()` or any funds that are no longer locked after cancellation)
- NFTs can be stolen from the `WinnablesPrizeManager` via `withdrawNFT(address,uint256)`


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `Roles::_setRole` function to properly handle both granting and revoking roles based on the `status` parameter:

```diff
function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);

+   if (status) {
+       roles |= (1 << role);
+   } else {
+       roles &= ~(1 << role);
+   }
+
+   _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles);
-   _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

This modification ensures that roles can be both granted and revoked, aligning with the function's intended behavior and improving the contract's security and flexibility.
