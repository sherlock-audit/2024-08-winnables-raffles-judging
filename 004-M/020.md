# `_setRole()` always grants the user the role, regardless of whether `status` is set to true or false

### Summary

Wrong implementation of `Roles._setRole()` will cause an admin to only be able to grant roles, but unable to deny any of them once granted.

### Root Cause

In `Roles`, the function `_setRole()` allows an admin to grant/deny any roles to a `user`. The status of the new role is determined by `status`:

```solidity
function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
    _setRole(user, role, status);
}
```

This calls into the internal function `_setRole()`:

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role)); // @audit this always turns a bit on
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```

Note that in the middle line, `roles | (1 << role)` will always turn the "role"-th bit on in `_addressRoles[user]`, thus granting the `user` the role regardless of what `status` was called at.

Therefore calling `setRole()` will always *grant* the user the role, never revoking them.

### Impact

Admin is not able to deny roles once granted. This contradicts the README statement:
> Role 0 is an admin role and it allows its members to grant or deny roles to other users.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the function `_setRole()` to as following: 

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (_hasRole(user, role) != status) {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles ^ (1 << role));
    }
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
