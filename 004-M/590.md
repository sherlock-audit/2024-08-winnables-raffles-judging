# Admin cannot remove an existing role in case of address compromise

## Summary

In Roles.sol, an admin can only add roles to addresses but cannot remove them in case the addresses are compromised, malicious or just need to removed in case of protocol deprecation.

## Vulnerability Detail

As we can see in the Roles contract, an admin can only add roles and cannot remove them in case of an emergency. Since the `status` parameter is unused in determining the `_addressRoles` of an actor, the roles can only be activated and not deactivated.
```solidity
   function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }

    function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
        _setRole(user, role, status);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using another mapping that tracks the bool status variable. This would also require implementing another function that allows an admin to set the status to false. In function setRole(), the status would need to be set to true.
