# Admin cannot deny roles to other users.

## Summary
The `Roles._setRole` function can only be used to grant roles to other users, but not to deny them, which is inconsistent with the audit statement, and breaks the core functionality of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the audit statement, the admin role can grant or deny roles to other users.
```text
Access control is handled with the Roles contract. It works similar to OpenZeppelin's AcessControl but uses bit flags to determine if a user has a role or not. Each user has a bytes32 representing the bitfield of roles so there is a limit of 256 possible roles. We only use 2: 0 and 1.

Role 0 is an admin role and it allows its members to grant or deny roles to other users. That role is granted to the deployer in the constructor.

The granting and denial of roles are handled by the `Roles._setRole` function. However, this function can only be used to grant roles, because it only sets the bit corresponding to the role (L31), but cannot clear the bit. The `status` parameter is intended to indicate whether to grant or deny the role, but it is not used when updating the role bits.
```solidity
29:    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
30:        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
31:@>      _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
32:        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
33:    }
```

## Impact
Admin cannot deny roles to other users. Since role 1 is used for purchasing tickets, admin cannot prevent malicious users who have been granted role 1 from buying tickets.

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
-       _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
+       if (status) {
+           _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
+       } else {
+           _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
+       }
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
