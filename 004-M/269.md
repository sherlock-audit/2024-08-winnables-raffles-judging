# Missing Role Revocation Functionality in `Roles` Contract

### Summary
The `Roles` contract lacks functionality to revoke roles from a user. The `setRole` function only adds roles to a user's existing set of roles without providing a mechanism to remove or revoke a role. This can lead to a situation where a user accumulates multiple roles, even if some of them are no longer appropriate or intended.

### Vulnerability Detail
The `setRole` function in the `Roles` contract only adds new roles to the existing roles of a user by performing a bitwise OR operation. However, there is no mechanism to revoke or remove a role once it has been assigned. This can lead to potential security risks, especially in cases where roles need to be dynamically managed.

For example:
- If a user is assigned role `1`, and later assigned role `0`, the user will end up holding both roles `1` and `0`.
- Similarly, if a user is first assigned role `0` and then role `1`, the user will again hold both roles.

This situation occurs because the contract only adds roles and does not provide any functionality to revoke them, potentially leading to users having unintended or excessive permissions.

### Impact
The inability to revoke roles from users can result in users retaining privileges that they should no longer have. This can lead to security vulnerabilities where users with revoked access rights still retain certain permissions, increasing the risk of unauthorized actions within the contract.

### Code Snippet

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));  // @audit bitwise OR operation only adds roles
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}

function setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) external virtual onlyRole(0) {
    _setRole(user, role, status);
}
```

### Tool used
Manual Review

### Recommendation
To address this issue, introduce a mechanism that allows roles to be revoked. This could involve modifying the `setRole` function to handle both adding and removing roles, depending on the `status` parameter. A potential implementation could involve using bitwise operations to clear the specific bit corresponding to the role when revocation is required.

```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (status) {
        // Add the role
        roles |= (1 << role);
    } else {
        // Revoke the role
        roles &= ~(1 << role);
    }
    _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles);
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
