# Inconsistent Role Management in `_setRole` Function Due to Ignored `status` Parameter

## Summary
The `_setRole` function in the Roles contract is intended to manage user roles by setting or removing specific roles based on the `status` parameter(as per discussed with protocol team). However, the current implementation always sets the role regardless of the status parameter in the function;
```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
        uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
        emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
    }
```
which is intended to determine whether the role should be set or removed
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_setRole` function currently uses the bitwise OR operation `(roles | (1 << role))` to set the bit corresponding to the specified role to one. This operation effectively adds the role to the user's roles, regardless of the value of the status parameter. The status parameter is intended to control whether a role should be added (set to true) or removed (set to false). However, due to the current implementation, the role is always set to true, and there is no mechanism to remove a role if status is false. This means that once a role is set, it cannot be unset using this function

## Impact
Inability to Remove Roles which goes against protocol's intended behavioiur.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the function can both set and remove roles based on the status parameter.
```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (status) {
        // Set the role
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    } else {
        // Remove the role
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
    }
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
