# Lack of re-checking LINK balance before sending message leads to potential transaction failures due to LINK balance changes between fee calculation and message sending

### Summary

The lack of re-checking the `LINK`  balance immediately before sending the message will cause potential transaction failures for the contract users as legitimate transactions could alter the `LINK` balance between the `fee calculation and message sending`, `leading to insufficient funds for the transaction`. 

This operational issue can be mitigated by implementing an additional balance check immediately before the message is sent, ensuring that the balance remains sufficient and improving the reliability of the contract.

### Mathematical proof:

- Let F be the calculated fee required to send the message.
```solidity
uint256 fee = router.getFee(ccipDestChainSelector, message);
```

- Let B be the current LINK balance of the contract.
```solidity
uint256 currentLinkBalance = linkToken.balanceOf(address(this));
```

- The contract checks if the fee F is greater than the balance B.
```solidity
if (fee > currentLinkBalance) {
            revert InsufficientLinkBalance(currentLinkBalance, fee);
        }
```

- There is a time gap between the balance check and the message sending. During this time gap, the balance B can change due to other transactions.
-  Let ΔB be the change in balance during the time gap.
The new balance B' after the change is: [ B' = B + ΔB ]

- If ΔB is negative (i.e., LINK tokens are withdrawn or spent in other transactions), and the absolute value of ΔB is greater than the difference between B and F, then the new balance B' will be less than the required fee F.
Mathematically: [ |ΔB| > B - F \implies B' < F ]
This means: [ B' = B + ΔB < F ]

### Example:

**Initial State:**

- Calculated fee `F = 50 LINK`.
- Initial balance `B = 100 LINK`.

**Fee Calculation and Balance Check:**

- The contract calculates the fee `F` to be 50 LINK.
- The contract checks the balance `B` and finds it to be 100 LINK.
- The condition `if (F > B)` is false, so the transaction proceeds.

**Concurrent Transactions and Balance Change:**

- During the time gap, an external transaction withdraws 60 LINK from the contract.
- The new balance `B'` is: `B' = B + ΔB = 100 - 60 = 40 LINK`.

**Attempt to Send Message:**

- The contract attempts to send the message with a fee of 50 LINK.
- The new balance `B'` (40 LINK) is insufficient to cover the fee `F` (50 LINK).
- The transaction fails due to insufficient funds.


### Root Cause

- In the `_sendCCIPMessage`  function, the LINK balance is checked after calculating the fee, but there is no re-check immediately before sending the message. This issue is exacerbated by external/public functions that call `_sendCCIPMessage`, increasing the risk of concurrent transactions affecting the LINK balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

-  Multiple transactions need to be processed concurrently: Any user needs to initiate multiple transactions to set `currentLinkBalance` to be at most the calculated fee.
- Public or external functions need to call `_sendCCIPMessage`: Any user needs to call public or external functions that invoke `_sendCCIPMessage`.

### External pre-conditions

The issue is primarily a logical flaw within the `BaseCCIPSender.sol` and does not depend on external pre-conditions. The vulnerability arises from the internal handling of LINK balance checks and the potential for race conditions due to concurrent transactions and if manual monitoring.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker or multiple users initiate multiple transactions that interact with the contract. Lets say `function propagateRaffleWinner`
```solidity
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

2. The contract calculates the fee and checks the LINK balance. `_sendCCIPMessage`
```solidity

uint256 fee = router.getFee(
            ccipDestChainSelector,
            message
        );
        uint256 currentLinkBalance = linkToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (fee > currentLinkBalance) {
            revert InsufficientLinkBalance(currentLinkBalance, fee);
        }
```

3. While the fee is being calculated and the balance is being checked, other transactions (initiated by the attacker or other users) affect the LINK balance.
4. The contract attempts to send the message using the `router.ccipSend` function.
```solidity
messageId = router.ccipSend(ccipDestChainSelector, message);
```
5. Due to the concurrent transactions affecting the LINK balance, the balance is now insufficient to cover the fee calculated earlier. The transaction fails because the contract does not have enough LINK to cover the fee.

### Impact

Legitimate transactions could alter the LINK balance between the fee calculation and message sending, leading to potential transaction failures.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Re-check the LINK balance immediately before sending the message to ensure it is still sufficient in `function _sendCCIPMessage`
