# `WinnablesPrizeManager::lockETH` function is marked payable but `msg.value` is not handled, eth can get locked.

## Summary
`WinnablesPrizeManager::lockETH` function is marked payable but `msg.value` is not handled, eth can get locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `WinnablesPrizeManager::lockETH` function:
```solidity
    /// @notice (Admin) Send the prize for a Raffle to its rightful winner
    /// @param ticketManager Address of the Ticket Manager on the remote chain
    /// @param chainSelector CCIP Chain selector of the remote chain
    /// @param raffleId ID of the Raffle that will be associated
    /// @param amount Amount of ETH to lock as a prize
    function lockETH(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint256 amount
    ) external payable onlyRole(0) {
        //@audit the function is marked payable but there's no handling of `msg.value`
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;

        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();/
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
        _ethLocked += amount;
        _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```
Although this function is marked with `onlyRole(0)` modifier which means only admin can access this function. But if accidentally the admin sends funds to this function it will get locked as `msg.value` is not handled.

According to the comments of the function -
```solidity
   /// @notice (Admin) Send the prize for a Raffle to its rightful winner
```
The function is expected to send the prize to the winner by the admin. 
**My assumption** : The reason I understand for marking this function as payable can be :
admin will call the function with the required fund won by the winner and send them, then there should be handling of `msg.value`

In input parameters `uint256 amount` which is `/// @param amount Amount of ETH to lock as a prize` 
Hence, if my assumption above is correct then `amount` should be equal to `msg.value` otherwise `amount` and `msg.value` can be different as there is no check to prevent that. 

## Impact
1. Eth send to this function can get locked
2. If my assumption is correct then, amount can be different from `msg.value`  but still eth will get locked

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either remove the `payable` keyword from the function or handle `msg.value` accordingly.
If the assumption is correct, then assign `amount=msg.value`
