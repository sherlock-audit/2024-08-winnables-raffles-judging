# An attacker will steal funds from the contract by exploiting a reentrancy vulnerability

### Summary

The missing reentrancy guard in the withdrawETH function allows an attacker to repeatedly call the function before the previous execution completes. This could lead to the attacker draining the entire balance of the contract.

### Root Cause

The withdrawETH function in the smart contract lacks a reentrancy guard, which permits an attacker to repeatedly call the function before the first call is completed. This oversight allows the attacker to continuously withdraw funds from the contract, potentially draining all ETH from the contract's balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker has a small amount of ETH in the contract.
The withdrawETH function is callable by the attacker without restrictions.
There is a significant amount of ETH in the contract's balance.

### External pre-conditions

The contract contains a balance of ETH.
The attacker has an address with ETH in the contract.
No other function or guard in the contract prevents reentrant calls.

### Attack Path

The attacker initiates the withdrawETH function.
Before the first execution completes, the attacker triggers another withdrawETH call via a fallback function in a smart contract.
The attacker repeats this process until all ETH is drained from the contract.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of funds. The attacker successfully drains all ETH from the contract's balance by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. This could result in significant financial loss for the contract and its users.

            vulnerableContract.withdrawETH();
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
The VulnerableRaffle contract has a vulnerable withdrawETH function.
The Attacker contract is designed to exploit this vulnerability. When attack() is called, it initiates the withdrawETH function.
When the contract sends ETH back to the Attacker, the fallback function (receive()) is triggered, allowing the attacker to re-enter the withdrawETH function before the first execution completes.
This loop continues until all ETH in the vulnerable contract is drained.

### Mitigation

Explanation of Mitigation:
ReentrancyGuard: By inheriting from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard, we can use the nonReentrant modifier to prevent reentrant calls to the withdrawETH function.
nonReentrant Modifier: This modifier ensures that a function cannot be entered again while it is still executing. It effectively blocks reentrancy attacks.
Other Security Considerations: Always consider using the checks-effects-interactions pattern and carefully managing your contract's state before interacting with external contracts.
