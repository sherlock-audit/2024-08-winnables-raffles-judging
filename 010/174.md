## Summary

According to the Chainlink developers, VRF v2.0 will soon be deprecated and won’t be available to be used, making the `Winnables` protocol non-functional.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are few important modifications from v2.5 compared to v2.0 that will make the protocol non-compliant with the new VRF architecture:

- `subscriptionId` is now of type uint256, instead of `uint64`
- `requestRandomWords` now expect struct `RandomWordsRequest` and has one additional parameter `extraArgs`, that entirely changes the signature of the function.

The second change is most significant and it will prevent the protocol from drawing raffle winners.

Here are some evidences that the v2.0 will be deprecated and all the protocols should migrate to v2.5:

1. In Chainlink’s website there is only information about `VRF` v2.5 - https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks#avalanche-mainnet
2. Chainlink devs advise to have way to upgrade the RNG provider, which is also lacking in the `Winnables` - https://discord.com/channels/592041321326182401/722867054197080136/1212405083741098004

3. V1 which also has been deprecated is entirely removed and can be used at all - https://discord.com/channels/592041321326182401/605768708266131456/1170984140447948820
4. The final date of deprecation for V2 is November 29, 2024, confirmed - https://discord.com/channels/592041321326182401/722867054197080136/1274768576582123611
