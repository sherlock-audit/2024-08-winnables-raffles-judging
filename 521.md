# Risk of overflow and failure when trying to withdraw ETH from the WinnablesTicketManager.sol contract

## Summary
Risk of overflow and failure when trying to withdraw ETH from the WinnablesTicketManager.sol contract

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawETH` function, using the unchecked block can mask the error of subtracting `_lockETH` from `address(this).balance`, if it is smaller than `_lockETH`. The result may overflow and the transaction in `_sendETH` fails.

## Impact
Using the unchecked block can mask the error of subtracting `_lockETH` from `address(this).balance`, if it is smaller than `_lockETH`. The result may overflow and the transaction in `_sendETH` fails as the contract will not have enough ETH.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Specialized libraries can be used that provide secure functions for these operations. One of these libraries is OpenZeppelin's SafeMath, which offers mathematical functions that throw exceptions in case of overflow or underflow, helping to prevent common errors in numerical calculations.
