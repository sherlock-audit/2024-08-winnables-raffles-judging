# Anyone can buy tickets with 0 commitment

### Summary

While participating in Raffle by calling `buyTickets(...)`, the caller pays in Native tokens which is not being checked. As a result, the caller can buy tickets with out paying native tokens.




### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicketManager.sol::buyTickets(...)` function, the  number of tickets purchased should be against the amount of native tokens transferred. But, there is not such check.

In the `buyTickets(...)` function, the caller can pass 0 native tokens and claim participation in a raffle. The participation should be based on funds contributed to raffle in the form of tickets.

```solidity
   function buyTickets(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
        _checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);

        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[msg.sender]);
        uint128 totalPaid = uint128(participation) + uint128(msg.value);
        uint32 totalPurchased = uint32(participation >> 128) + uint32(ticketCount);
        unchecked {
            raffle.participations[msg.sender] = bytes32(
                (participation & type(uint256).max << 160)
                | totalPaid |
                uint256(totalPurchased) << 128
            );
        }
        unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).mint(msg.sender, raffleId, ticketCount);
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker can call `WinnablesTicketManager.sol::buyTickets(...)` specifying the number of tickets for a raffle id.
2. Attacker passed 0 value and still be able to participate in the raffle by minting tickets in the favour of the caller.


### External pre-conditions

1. RaffleId should be valid
2. Tickets should be purchasable based on start and end times and status
 

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `WinnablesTicketManager.sol::buyTickets(...)`  function to mint tickets to participate in the raffle
2. Attacker pass 0 native tokens while calling the `buyTickets(...)` to successfully register for a raffle. 



### Impact

- With out contributing to the raffle, the caller is able to successfully register for participation
- The participation is at par with other users who also registered for participation in the raffle.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Native tokens are passed is as the commitment for the participation in the raffle. The logic should be enforcing to make the participant contribute to the form of native tokens. There should be a validation logic to ensure that caller commits to the raffle by contributing the native tokens.

In the absence of commitment, the call should revert.
