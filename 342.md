# `WinnablesTicketManager::_getWinnerByRequestId` Prevents Potential Winners from Receiving the Winner Title Due to `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` Reverting When the Winner's Ticket is the Last One in the Raffle

## Summary
**description:** The `WinnablesTicketManager::_getWinnerByRequestId` function relies on the `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` method to return the address of the owner of the winning ticket. However, if the winning ticket is the last ticket in the raffle, calling `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` will trigger a revert. This issue prevents the function from returning the correct winner and undermines the fairness and reliability of the protocol's intended operations.

## Vulnerability Details 
The below codes are to be used in Foundry and are designed to target this specific issue, Please review the Code Snippets below.

**Foundry Test Contract** information
1. We created a foundry testing environment that is specifically targeting the returning values of the `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` as follows in the code below. <br>
2. Explanation: We use the mapping that is used to store the ticket owners address with a uint value for the raffle id and the last uint value for the ticketID. We create a new function to set a raffleId, ticketId and an address to the `_ticketOwnership` and increase the mapping _supplies. Most functions have been changed to public for testing and ease of accessibility.

**Foundry Test** information
1. For this Test we create a `setTicketOwnership()` function so that we can test the returning address value of the tickets that could poteintailly be drawn as the winner.<br>
2. We then set 3 users and give them a ticket each in the raffleId number 2.<br>
4. We now make all the users winners to see what the return address values are, user1 and user2 return value passes, user3 return address values are reverted because user3's ticket is the last in the array and when going through the check in `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` the function is reverted.

```js

pragma solidity 0.8.24;

    mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => address)) public _ticketOwnership;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public _supplies;


    function _getWinnerByRequestId(uint256 raffleId, uint256 winningTicketNumber) public view returns(address) {
        return ownerOf(raffleId, winningTicketNumber);
    }

    function setTicketOwnership(uint256 raffleId, uint256 ticketId, address owner) external {
    _ticketOwnership[raffleId][ticketId] = owner;
    _supplies[raffleId] = ticketId;
    }

    function ownerOf(uint256 id, uint256 ticketId) public view returns (address) {
    if (ticketId >= _supplies[id]) {
      revert InexistentTicket();
    }
    while (_ticketOwnership[id][ticketId] == address(0)) {
      unchecked { --ticketId; }
    }
    return _ticketOwnership[id][ticketId];
    }
}

## Impact
This issue impacts the fairness of the protocol by preventing all ticket holders from having an equal chance to win. As the protocol currently stands, the `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf` function will never return the address of the holder of the last ticket. This gives all other ticket holders a disproportionately better chance of winning.

## Tools Used
* Foundry
* Manual Review

## Recommendations
**Mitigation 1:** To address this issue, modify the check to ensure that it only reverts if the ticket number is greater than the `_supplies` array. This adjustment will ensure that the last ticket holder has the same chance to win as the rest of the participants, maintaining fairness in the protocol.

**Mitigation 2:** Additionally, to further enhance fairness, ensure that winners are selected randomly and that the zero address, which is checked to prevent being selected, does not occur. If a zero address is returned, re-run the process to select a new random winner, thereby ensuring that all participants have an equal opportunity to win.
