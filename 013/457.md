# User's won't be able to buy tickets due to unauthorised call to mint() function

## Summary
The `buyTickets` function fails to mint raffle tickets because the `winnablesTicketManager.sol` contract lacks the necessary role to call the `mint` function in `winnableTicket.sol`, leading to transaction reverts and preventing users from purchasing tickets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `buyTickets()` function attempts to mint raffle tickets by calling the mint function in the `winnableTicket.sol` contract. The `mint()` function is protected by the `onlyRole(1)` modifier, which ensures that only authorized contracts or addresses with the designated role can execute the mint operation. In the current implementation, the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract has not been granted the necessary role. As a result, any call to the `mint` function will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert. This prevents users from successfully purchasing tickets.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is that users will be unable to purchase raffle tickets as intended, leading to a negative user experience

## Code Snippet
[`WinnablesTicketManager.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L208)

```solidity
    function buyTickets(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
        _checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);

        ....


        unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
@>      IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).mint(msg.sender, raffleId, ticketCount); //@audit
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```

[`WinnablesTicket.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182)

```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) { //@audit
        .... 
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract must be granted the necessary role `(onlyRole(1))` in the constructor.
