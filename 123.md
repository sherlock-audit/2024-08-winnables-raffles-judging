# Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The [_sendETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L482) function is utilized in a few different places in the contract. According to the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)), "The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed". As a result, it is possible that this call will fail, but `_sendETH` function will not notice anything went wrong. In particular, it is possible that the address `player` is a deleted contract (perhaps a security flaw was found and selfdestruct was called so that users know to use an updated smart contract), but `_sendETH`  will not revert. If  `player` is indeed a non-existent contract it would be better for `_sendETH` to revert until an admin can manually correct the `player`.
## Code Snippet
See [_sendETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L482).  See how this function is called with `to` as [player](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L224), but this contract's existence is not verified, which is a problem as described above.

## Recommendation

Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
