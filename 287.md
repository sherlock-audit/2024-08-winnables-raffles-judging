# Incorrect winner can win a Raffle Before it's fulfilled

## Summary
The getWinner function in the provided code snippet may potentially allow unauthorized access to the winner of a raffle before it's officially fulfilled. This will occur due to a logic flaw in the status check.
## Vulnerability Detail
The  `getWinner` function checks the raffle.status to ensure the raffle is fulfilled before returning the winner. However, the function uses a strict less-than comparison (<) for the RaffleStatus.FULFILLED check. 
```solidity
 function getWinner(uint256 raffleId) external view returns(address winner) {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status < RaffleStatus.FULFILLED || raffle.status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED) {
            revert RaffleNotFulfilled();
        }
        winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);
    }
```

This means that if the raffle.status is equal to RaffleStatus.FULFILLED, the function will proceed to return the winner without reverting.

This will lead to a situation where the raffle has not been fulfilled, but the `_getWinnerByRequestId` function hasn't returned the winner yet. In this case, the `getWinner` function would return an empty address or an incorrect winner.
## Impact
Incorrect winner can win the raffle even before it is fulfilled

-        if (raffle.status < RaffleStatus.FULFILLED || raffle.status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED) {

            revert RaffleNotFulfilled();
        }
        winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);
    }
