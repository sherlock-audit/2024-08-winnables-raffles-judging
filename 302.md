The raffle system's cross-chain communication mechanism lacks retry functionality for critical operations including raffle cancellation, winner propagation, and initial prize locking. If CCIP messages fail to be delivered or processed in any of these scenarios without reverting, it can lead to inconsistent states across chains, potentially locking prizes indefinitely or preventing winners from claiming their prizes.
In the docs of Chainlink:
```The message could not be executed on the destination chain within CCIPâ€™s Smart Execution time window, which is currently set to 8 hours. This could happen, for example, during extreme network congestion and resulting gas spikes.```

### Root Cause

The root cause is the immediate state change on the originating chain without waiting for confirmation from the receiving chain. This occurs in multiple functions:

1. cancelRaffle in TicketManager
2. propagateRaffleWinner in TicketManager
3. lockNFT (and similar locking functions) in PrizeManager

These functions change the local state before sending CCIP messages. If these messages fail without revert, there's no mechanism to resend them or revert the state changes, leading to mismatches between chains.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. For cancellation: A raffle must be in a cancellable state.
2. For winner propagation: A winner must have been selected.
3. For prize locking: An admin must initiate the prize lock.
4. The respective functions must be called on the appropriate contracts.

### External pre-conditions

1. The CCIP network must be operational but experience a failure in message delivery or processing.
2. The receiving contracts must be in states ready to receive the respective messages.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Inconsistent states between TicketManager and PrizeManager contracts.
2. Prizes may remain locked indefinitely or be unclaimed.
3. Inability to properly cancel raffles, propagate winners, or refund participants.
4. Potential financial loss due to locked or unclaimed prizes.
5. Violation of key principles: participants might not get refunds, winners might be unable to claim prizes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add retry mechanisms for all CCIP messages
