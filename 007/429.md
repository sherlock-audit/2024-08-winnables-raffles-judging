# _checkRaffleTimings function doesn't work as expected.

## Summary
The _checkRaffleTimings function tries to update the `startsAt` variable, but this change does not persist outside the scope of the function.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the `createRaffle` function is called, and if the `startsAt` varaible is less than the block.timestamp, the _checkRaffleTimings function is supposed to update it to block.timestamp. This does not work as intended since the `startsAt` variable is not passed as storage.
```solidity
function createRaffle(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint64 startsAt,
        uint64 endsAt,
        uint32 minTickets,
        uint32 maxTickets,
        uint32 maxHoldings
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        _checkRaffleTimings(startsAt, endsAt);
```
Here we can see that the `startsAt`, and `endsAt` variables are being passed as memory instead of storage. This would lead to any updates being made in the `_checkRaffleTimings` function being persisted only in that function scope.

```solidity
function _checkRaffleTimings(uint64 startsAt, uint64 endsAt) internal view {
        if (startsAt < block.timestamp) startsAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
        if (startsAt + MIN_RAFFLE_DURATION > endsAt) revert RaffleClosingTooSoon();
    }
```
This could lead to erroneous `startsAt` and raffle duration for a raffle.

Pass the variables as storage instead of memory.
