# Raffle can be created in past due to wrong implementation of `_checkRaffleTimings()`

## Summary
Raffle can be created in past due to wrong implementation of `_checkRaffleTimings()`

## Vulnerability Detail
A raffle is created using tokenManager:createRaffle(), which internally calls `_checkRaffleTimings()` to check that raffle's start time and end time are consistent with the rules.
```solidity
   function createRaffle(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint64 startsAt,
        uint64 endsAt,
        uint32 minTickets,
        uint32 maxTickets,
        uint32 maxHoldings
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
@>      _checkRaffleTimings(startsAt, endsAt);
...
    }
```

Rules:
1. if `startsAt` is less than `block.timestamp`, use block.timestamp as the reference
2. Raffle duration should be at least MIN_RAFFLE_DURATION
```solidity
    /// @dev Checks that a raffle's start time and end time are consistent with the rules:
    ///      - If startsAt is less than block.timestamp use block.timestamp as the reference
    ///      - Raffle duration should be at least MIN_RAFFLE_DURATION
    /// @param startsAt Raffle scheduled starting time
    /// @param endsAt Raffle scheduled ending time
    function _checkRaffleTimings(uint64 startsAt, uint64 endsAt) internal view {
@>      if (startsAt < block.timestamp) startsAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
        if (startsAt + MIN_RAFFLE_DURATION > endsAt) revert RaffleClosingTooSoon();
    }
```
Now the problem is, if `startAt` is less than block.timestamp then `startsAt = uint64(block.timestamp)` reflects only in _checkRaffleTimings() but not in createRaffle() because `startAt` is updated only for `_checkRaffleTimings()`

## Impact
Raffle can be created for past timestamp

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Integrate the checks of `_checkRaffleTimings()` in createRaffle() itself or return the updated value of startsAt from `_checkRaffleTimings` & use it in createRaffle()
