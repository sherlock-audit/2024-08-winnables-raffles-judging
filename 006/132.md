# Ticket Prices are not enforced in TicketManager

## Summary
By calling directly from contract user can purchase tickets from ticket manager with 0 ether sent.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L181

For Non-Free Raffles the TicketManager assumes buyTicket is only going to be called from the frontend which enforces the ticket price, but a user can get the api signature(by copying directly from the browser console if it is exposed there, or reusing a signature from a previous purchase, or attempting to buy a ticket from the frontend without confiming the transaction and extracting from the data). Then using this signature to call directly from the contract with 0 ether sent and then pass all checks and gets the number of tickets they want.

```solidity
function testUserPurchasesTicketsWith0Eth() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        // raffle created with ticket price intended to be 0.1eth (not enforced in code)
        winnablesTicketManager.createRaffle(0, uint64(block.timestamp), uint64(block.timestamp+ 60) , 3, 5, 3);
        winnablesTicket.setRole(address(winnablesTicketManager), 1, true);

        vm.deal(address(3), 10e18);
        vm.startPrank(address(3));

        console.log(address(3).balance);
       
        //signature obtained offchain
        bytes memory signature = "";
        //user buys 3 tickets with 0 value sent
        winnablesTicketManager.buyTickets{value: 0}(0, 3, 0, signature);
    }
```

## Impact
User gains ticket entries for free

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inspite of how ticket prices is enforced offchain through signatures, they should also be enforced in contract logic, by requiring enough ether is sent to purchase an amount of tickets.
