# `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function doesn't checks for `msg.value=0` condition, one can buy tickets for free.

## Summary
No checks present in the `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function to ensure `msg.value` can't be zero, if it becomes zero then one can buy tickets for free.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function :
```solidity
    function buyTickets(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
        _checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);

        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[msg.sender]);
        uint128 totalPaid = uint128(participation) + uint128(msg.value);
        
        uint32 totalPurchased = uint32(participation >> 128) + uint32(ticketCount);
        unchecked {
            raffle.participations[msg.sender] = bytes32(
                (participation & type(uint256).max << 160)
                | totalPaid |
                uint256(totalPurchased) << 128
            );
        }
        unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).mint(msg.sender, raffleId, ticketCount);
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    }
```
The function is marked payable in order for an user to send funds and purchase tickets. But there are no checks made to ensure the value sent to this function can't be zero. Anyone can call the function without sending any eth and buy tickets.

## Impact
Impact: High
Likelihood: High
I am marking this issue as high as anyone can call the function and buy tickets for free(i.e. without sending eth).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks to ensure `msg.value` can't be `0`.
E.g.
```diff
++ if(msg.value==0) revert zeroValueSent();
```
