# WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function doesn't checks for `msg.value=0` condition, one can buy tickets for free.

## Summary
There is no check present in the `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function to ensure `msg.value` can't be zero, if it becomes zero then one can buy tickets for free.


## Vulnerability Detail
The function is marked payable in order for an user to send funds and purchase tickets. But there are no checks made to ensure the value sent to this function can't be zero. Anyone can call the function without sending any eth and buy tickets.Even the function  `WinnablesTicketManager::_checkPurchaseSig` which is callled in `buyTickets` to check the signature isnt validating msg.value.
## Impact
One can buy the ticket for free.
