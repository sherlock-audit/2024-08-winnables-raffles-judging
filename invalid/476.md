# Smart Wallet Users Cannot Claim Prizes, Causing Funds to Be Stuck in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` Contract

### Summary

Account abstraction wallets or smart wallets have different addresses on different blockchains, which can cause prize claims to fail for legitimate winners using these wallets. In this protocol, the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract operates on Ethereum, while the `WinnablesTicketManager` and `WinnablesTicket` contracts are on Avalanche.

Here's how the issue arises:

1. Users purchase tickets through the `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function, which mints tickets and stores the user’s address in the contract.
  
2. Raffle winners are selected using the `propagateRaffleWinner` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract. The winner's Avalanche address is then sent to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract on Ethereum via a Chainlink CCIP message:
    ```solidity
    _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
    ```

3. The message sent contains the winner’s Avalanche wallet address, which is stored in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.
```solidity
        (raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
        _rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
```
When the winner tries to claim their prize using the `claimPrize` function in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract on Ethereum, the transaction reverts because their Ethereum address differs from their Avalanche wallet address. Moreover, as long as the raffle is not canceled, the admin cannot withdraw the funds from the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.

As a result, the funds remain locked in the contract with no way to retrieve them. Additionally, a malicious actor with the same address on Ethereum could potentially claim the prize.

### Root Cause

The design choice of associating prize claims with specific wallet addresses fails for account abstraction wallets or smart wallets. These wallets have different addresses across different blockchains, leading to an inability for legitimate winners to claim their prizes. The `claimPrize` function relies solely on address matching without considering cross-chain wallet address variations.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user wins a raffle using an account abstraction wallet.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user wins a raffle using a smart wallet.
2. The `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract on Ethereum records the winning address.
3. The user attempts to claim their prize using their smart wallet on Ethereum, but the address does not match the recorded winner address.
4. The claim fails, leaving the prize amount stuck in the contract.
5. Alternatively, a malicious actor with the same address on Ethereum as the smart wallet’s address attempts to claim the prize.
6. The malicious actor successfully claims the prize, although this scenario is less likely.

### Impact

The legitimate winner cannot claim their prize, leading to the loss of their reward. The prize amount remains stuck in the contract with no method to retrieve it, even by the admin. The Winnables protocol suffers from locked funds and a potential reputation hit due to the inability to deliver prizes to legitimate winners. Additionally, in rare cases, a malicious actor may claim the prize, leading to an unauthorized gain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner` function so that it only selects the winner. Introduce a separate function that allows the winner to update their address if necessary before sending the CCIP message. This adjustment ensures that users with smart wallets can successfully claim their prize on Ethereum.
