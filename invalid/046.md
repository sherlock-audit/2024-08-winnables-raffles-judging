# Dos of LockETH function due to underflow in claimPrize() function

### Summary

In `WinnablesPrizeManager:claimPrize()` , claims raffle prize for the winner . If the winner call claimPrize() more than once which will cause the _ethlocked to underflow to `( type(uint256).max - 1 )` which is possible through reentrency / external call  in  ` sendETHPrize()`. which will dos lockETH due to _ethLocked being higher than ethbalance

### Root Cause

In ` WinnablesPrizeManager:118 ` causes reentrency inside the function which user can claim more than once
` WinnablesPrizeManager:117` if the _ethLocked claim till  its `0 - _ethRaffles[raffleId]` which cause under flow and will dos the lockETH function 

```solidity 
  if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();

### Internal pre-conditions

1. admin locks 1 ETH 
2. admin creates a raffle 

### External pre-conditions

1.    alice needs to be the winner of the ETH raffle.



### Attack Path

1. assume tickets has been bought and all check passed
2. alice calls getWinner().
3. alice becomes winner 
4. alice 3 times calls claimPrize() with a fallback function inside its contract calling claimPrize();
5. after calling 3 times the _ethLocked will underflow dosing the lockETH function 

### Impact

dos of the lockETH function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use `safe math ` to protect against interger underflow or overflows and add reentrency gaurd .
