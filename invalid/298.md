# An attacker can DoS honest user by block stuffing, to grief the protocol or for own benefits

## Summary

An attacker can deny the purchase of tickets of honest users, thus benefitting from it. Like for example winning raffles or having greater advantage when the winner is chosen. 

In order for users to participate in the raffle they must buy tickets, the greater the amount, the greater the chance to be selected as winner. But as per docs, first the purchases need to be authorized via a signature from an API.

## Vulnerability Detail

If we follow the ticket purchasing process: 

```javascript
        ...
    /// @param blockNumber Number of the block when the signature expires
    /// @param signature Signature provided by the API to authorize this ticket sale at given price
    function buyTickets(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external payable {
        if (ticketCount == 0) revert InvalidTicketCount();
        _checkTicketPurchaseable(raffleId, ticketCount);
        _checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);
        ...

/// @dev Checks the validity of a signature to allow the purchase of tickets at a given price
    /// @param raffleId ID of the Raffle
    /// @param ticketCount Number of tickets purchased
    /// @param blockNumber Number of the block when the signature expires
    /// @param signature Signature to check
    function _checkPurchaseSig(uint256 raffleId, uint16 ticketCount, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata signature) internal view {
        if (blockNumber < block.number) revert ExpiredCoupon();
        address signer = _getSigner(
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked(
                    msg.sender, _userNonces[msg.sender], raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, msg.value
                )
            ), signature
        );
        if (!_hasRole(signer, 1)) revert Unauthorized();
    }
```
We can see that `block.number` value is used to check the signature's expirity. But this value can be manipulated by an attacker via [block stuffing](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-anatomy-of-a-block-stuffing-attack-a488698732ae), which means an attacker filling up a whole block with dummy transactions. The ticket purchase happens in `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, which will be deployed on Avalanche network. Let's calculate how much it would cost an attacker to execute such an attack on Avalanche: 

- Avalanche network's gas limit is currently set to [15m gas units](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6169826-how-are-gas-fees-calculated)
- As of writing this report (19.08) [here](https://snowtrace.io/gastracker) we see that the gas costs are:
    - Slow: 25 nAVAX (GWEI) -> 0.011$ on C-chain
    - Standard: 28 nAVAX (GWEI) -> 0.012$ on C-chain
    - Fast: 31 nAVAX (GWEI) -> 0.014$ on C-chain
- [Here](https://coinmarketcap.com/bg/currencies/avalanche/) we check the current price: 1 AVAX = 20.77$

If we choose the highest gas price:

- 31 GWEI will be 0.000000031 AVAX per gas unit.
- Cost per block will be: 15m * 0.000000025 AVAX = 0,465 AVAX
- Cost in USD: 0,465 AVAX * 20,77$ = ~9,65$ 

It will cost almost 10$ to fill up a block. An attacker can simply choose to DoS users from participating the raffles, or perform the attack in some edge cases where he can be chosen as the winner. A brief example:

1. Raffle with max cap 100, duration 1 hour
2. Attacker buys 10% of the tickets, a user uses the strategy to wait until the last moments of his signature expiry and submits a tx to purchase the rest 90%, because his chances of winning will be 9/10
3. Attacker fills up the block/s, and his tx reverts due to expiry

There are many ways to benefit from this attack path, especially in case where the reward is significant amount, the attacker will be incentivized to execute it.

## Recommendation

As of the nature of the attack, it's hard to give exact solution. I would suggest to remove the `block.number` check as it's very easy exploitable
