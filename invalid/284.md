# DOS in refundPlayers function

## Summary
The` refundPlayers` function can be DOSed by including an addreess within the players array that does not receive ETH. This can cause the function to revert, halting the refund process of other players.
## Vulnerability Detail
The refundPlayers function iterates over a list of players, attempting to refund each one. 
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
             address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
            _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
```
The issue lies in the `_sendEth` function call.If the function reverts for any reasong such as recepient address not being able to receive Eth, the entire loop is terminated, preventing refunds of other players
## Impact
Players will loss funds if they join the raffle using other tokens or NFTs

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the `_sendEth` call in a try-catch block to handle failures

or use an implementation like this

```solidity
   function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
        address player = players[i];
        uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
        if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
        raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
        uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
        bool success = false;
        // Try to send ETH, but continue even if it fails
        assembly {
            let transferSuccess := call(sub(gas(), 21000), player, amountToSend, 0, 0, 0, 0)
            success := eq(transferSuccess, 1)
        }
        if (!success) {
            // Log failed refund attempt
            emit RefundFailed(raffleId, player, amountToSend);
        } else {
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
        }
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}

```
