# Users buying too many tickets will DoS them and the protocol if they are the winner due to OOG

### Summary

`WinnablesTicket` stores `nft` ownership by setting the first minted nft id ownership to the user minting and all the next minted nfts remain as `0`. This means it always costs the same to mint, but the `ownerOf()` function becomes much more expensive, to the point where it may cause OOG errors. In this case, the user is able to buy tickets via [WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182), the draw is made in [WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L310) and the chainlink request is fulfilled with the winner in [WinnablesTicketManager::fulfillRandomWords()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L350). However, in [WinnablesTicketManager::propagateWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334), it reverts due to OOG when calling [WinnablesTicket::ownerOf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L97-L99).

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicket:97-99`, it may run out of gas if enough tickets were bought.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin sets max holdings and max tickets to a number of at least 4000 or simillar.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users by tickets via WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets()`
2. The draw is made in `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner()` 
3. The chainlink request is fulfilled with the winner in `WinnablesTicketManager::fulfillRandomWords()]
4. In `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateWinner()`, it reverts due to OOG when calling `WinnablesTicket::ownerOf()`.

### Impact

DoSed winner and protocol `ETH` from the raffle.

### PoC

The following test costs 9 million gas, more than the block limit on Avalanche.

        winnablesTicket.mint(owner, 1, 4000);

        winnablesTicket.ownerOf(1, 3999);
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

Set a reasonable cap for max holdings.
