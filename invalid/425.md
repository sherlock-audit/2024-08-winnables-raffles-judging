# WinnablesPrizeManager contract will not work with fee on transfer tokens.

### Summary

As the team states: "We are supposed to support all 100% valid ERC20 tokens + USDC and USDT." lets take a look at this case.
WinnablesPrizeManager contract will not work with fee on transfer tokens because when the prize is tokens that have fee on transfer. Lets explore the behaviour of such tokens:
Some fee on transfer tokens, do not reduce the fee directly from the transferred amount, but subtracts it from remaining balance of sender. Some tokens prefer this approach, to make the amount received by the recipient an exact amount. Therefore, after funds are send to users, balance becomes less than it should be. 
Having said that we should look at how `WinnablesPrizeManager` stores balances.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196
So when an admin decides to withdraw tokens with `withdrawToken` function an amount will be send in this case `availableBalance`,
but the fee will be substracted from the remaining supply, leaving `_tokensLocked` mapping with more tokens that the supply of the contract itself.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L218
This will result in `claimPrize` reverting due to insufficient balance.
 

### Root Cause

Root cause is the way to protocol calculates and stores the balance for ERC20 tokens especially those with fee on transfer.
Token balance is calculated in `withdrawToken` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L219
When those tokens are transferred  some of the fee on transfer tokens will deduct the fee from the balance , leaving the balance of the contract with less that stored in the mapping `_tokensLocked`.
Now if a user wins the raffle and claims his prize, the `claimPrize` function will be called that transfers `raffle.amount`.
If we have only one raffle using such tokens, the `raffle.amount` will be equal to supposed balance of the contract.
And when `_sendTokenPrize` function is called , the protocol will try to send more tokens that it currently have in it's balance , because it is lowered by the fees previously incurred.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A raffle is made using tokens that have fees when transferring.
2. Let's assume another is made with the same token , but fails.
3. The admin calls `withdrawToken` at some point in time to withdraw tokens that are not locked in a raffle.
4. Transfer is made and fee is incurred on the transfer which is deducted from the total balance of the contract.

### External pre-conditions

1. Just participants in the raffles are needed.

### Attack Path

No attack path  needed.

### Impact

The winner will not be able to claim his prize in ERC20 tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A check can be implemented to send just the remaining balance if it is lower than the locked ERC20 tokens in the mapping.
Or fee on transfer ERC20 can be excluded from the raffle.
