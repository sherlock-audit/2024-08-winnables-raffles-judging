# reverts when querying the owner of the latest ticketID of a raffle in WinnableTicket.sol

## Summary
off-by-one error

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function ownerOf(uint256 id, uint256 ticketId) public view returns (address) {
    if (ticketId >= _supplies[id]) {// @audit-issue off-by-one error? depends on how raffleID is chosen
      revert InexistentTicket();
```

The check above will revert if `ticketId` is the latest ticket id in the _supplies mapping for a raffle


 The check above should had been ticketID > _supplies[id] instead

## Impact
