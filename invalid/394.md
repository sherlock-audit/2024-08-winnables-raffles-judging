# Raffle Reversion Risk in Chainlink VRF Implementation

## Summary
According to [Chainlink VRF Security Considerations](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert):
```solidity
If your `fulfillRandomWords()` implementation reverts, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time. Make sure your contract logic does not revert.
```

## Vulnerability Detail
When the VRF service invokes `fulfillRandomWords()`, the function implementation checks that the raffle status is not set to `REQUESTED`. If it is, the function reverts with the message `RequestNotFound()`:
```solidity
     function fulfillRandomWords(
        uint256 requestId,
        uint256[] memory randomWords
     ) internal override {
        RequestStatus storage request = _chainlinkRequests[requestId];
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[request.raffleId];
@>      if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.REQUESTED) revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        request.randomWord = randomWords[0];
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.FULFILLED;
        emit WinnerDrawn(requestId);
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(request.raffleId);
     }
```
As we can see above, the function can potentially revert due to certain conditions. Once a revert happens, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time, and the raffle will no longer continue.

## Impact
If the `fulfillRandomWords()` implementation reverts, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As per the [Chainlink VRF Security Considerations](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert):  Consider simply storing the randomness and taking more complex follow-on actions in separate contract calls.
