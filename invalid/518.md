# Raffle Cancellable at Minimum Ticket Threshold

## Summary

The `WinnablesTicketManager` contract allows for the cancellation of a raffle even when the number of tickets sold has reached the minimum threshold. This unexpected behavior contradicts user expectations and creates a potential for manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, there's an overlap in the conditions for canceling and drawing a raffle when the exact minimum threshold of tickets is sold. This is evident in the following code snippets:

```solidity
function _checkShouldDraw(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    // ...
    if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
    // ...
}

function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    // ...
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    // ...
}
```

When the number of tickets sold (`supply`) exactly equals `raffle.minTicketsThreshold`, both of these conditions are satisfied:
1. The raffle is eligible for drawing (`currentTicketSold >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold`)
2. The raffle can still be canceled (`supply <= raffle.minTicketsThreshold`)

This creates a situation where a raffle that has met its minimum threshold and is eligible for a draw can unexpectedly be canceled.

## Impact

This vulnerability has several potential impacts:

1. **Manipulation Risk**: An actor with the ability to front-run transactions could potentially manipulate the outcome by choosing to cancel or allow the draw based on their preferences.

2. **Race Condition**: This overlap creates a potential race condition between canceling and drawing the raffle, where the outcome depends on which transaction is processed first.

3. **User Trust**: Participants who purchase tickets expecting the raffle to proceed once the minimum threshold is met may lose trust in the system if the raffle can still be canceled.

This edge case represents an unnecessary and easily mitigable risk that could lead to unexpected outcomes or potential manipulation.


## Proof of Concept
```solidity
function testCancelRaffleAtExactMinThreshold() public {
    uint256 raffleId = 1;
    uint32 minThreshold = 100;
    
    // Create a raffle
    ticketManager.createRaffle(raffleId, block.timestamp, block.timestamp + 1 days, minThreshold, 1000, 10);
    
    // Sell exactly minThreshold tickets
    for (uint i = 0; i < minThreshold; i++) {
        ticketManager.buyTickets(raffleId, 1, block.number + 100, validSignature);
    }
    
    // At this point, both of these calls would be valid:
    assert(ticketManager.shouldDrawRaffle(raffleId)); // This passes
    ticketManager.cancelRaffle(prizeManagerAddress, chainSelector, raffleId); // This also succeeds
    
    // The raffle ends up canceled despite meeting the minimum threshold
    (,,,,,, RaffleStatus status,) = ticketManager.getRaffle(raffleId);
    assert(status == RaffleStatus.CANCELED);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Modify the cancellation condition to strictly less than the minimum threshold:

   ```solidity
   function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
       // ...
       if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
       // ...
   }
   ```

By implementing this change the contract can provide a more predictable and fair experience for raffle participants, eliminating the unexpected cancellation scenario and reducing the risk of manipulation.
