# Inconsistent Block Number Handling Across L2 Chains in _checkPurchaseSig

## Summary
The `_checkPurchaseSig` function in the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract uses `block.number` to validate the expiration of a coupon. However, the interpretation of `block.number` differs between L2 chains like Optimism and Arbitrum, leading to potential inconsistencies and incorrect validation of coupons. This can result in valid transactions being incorrectly reverted, impacting the user experience and functionality of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Different Block Number Interpretations:
- Optimism: `block.number` reflects the L2 block number.
- Arbitrum: `block.number` reflects the L1 block number.
2. Time Inconsistency:
- In Optimism, `block.number` increases quickly (per L2 block).
- In Arbitrum, `block.number` increases more slowly (per L1 block).
3. Expired Coupon Check:
- A user in Arbitrum submits a transaction with a valid `blockNumber` for L1 but not for L2.
- The contract in Arbitrum checks `block.number` (the L1 block number), which may not have increased as expected.
- The contract incorrectly returns `ExpiredCoupon()` because the L1 block number has not yet matched the expected time in L2.

`if (blockNumber < block.number) revert ExpiredCoupon();`

Example:
Optimism:
- Current L2 block number: 1000
- User submits `blockNumber`: 1005
- `block.number` increases quickly, so the check passes.

Arbitrum:
- Current L1 block number: 500
- User submits `blockNumber`: 505
- `block.number` increases more slowly, so the check fails and the contract returns `ExpiredCoupon()`.

## Impact
- Users on Arbitrum may experience failed transactions due to incorrect expiration checks, leading to frustration and loss of trust.
- The contract may not function as intended across different L2 chains, potentially causing disruptions in ticket sales and raffle participation.
- Users may lose ETH due to failed transactions, and the project may face financial losses due to decreased participation and trust.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use a consistent time-based mechanism (e.g., Unix timestamps) instead of `block.number` to validate coupon expiration.
```solidity
function _checkPurchaseSig(uint256 raffleId, uint16 ticketCount, uint256 expiryTimestamp, bytes calldata signature) internal view {
    if (expiryTimestamp < block.timestamp) revert ExpiredCoupon();
    // Additional checks...
}
```
- Implement chain-specific logic to handle block number discrepancies.
- For Arbitrum, use `ArbSys(address(100)).arbBlockNumber()`.
```solidity
function _checkPurchaseSig(uint256 raffleId, uint16 ticketCount, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata signature) internal view {
    uint256 currentBlockNumber = block.number;
    if (block.chainid == 42161) { // Arbitrum chain ID
        currentBlockNumber = ArbSys(address(100)).arbBlockNumber();
    }
    if (blockNumber < currentBlockNumber) revert ExpiredCoupon();
    // Additional checks...
}
```
