# Incorrect locking of Native tokens can result in DOS

### Summary

`WinnablesPrizeManager::lockETH(...)` accepts amount as a parameter to the function, which is accounted as the amount of Eth tokens locked in the contract. But, the actual movement of eth tokens is via `payable` operator attached to the function. Due to this, user can specify 5 Eth as amount being locked, while passing 1 eth in msg.value as an example. Infact, msg.value can be passed as 0 as well.

As the contract tracks the balance for the user based on amount passed as parameter, this could result in DOS when calling `withdrawETH(...)` function because the actual balance in the contract will be lower than the tracked balance.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L172-L188

`lockETH(...)` function accepts Ether via the payable operator. The amount of Eth token accepted by the function is represented by `msg.value` in the context of the call. The function also accepts `amount` as a parameter which is currently being used for accounting the amount of ether locked.

If the user passes 5 ether as amount, while transferring only 1 ether in msg.value. The accounting of the system will register 5 ether as received ether.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Raffle id is valid in the system to lock Ether.
2. Attacker has 1 Ether in the account and calls `lockETH(...)` function with amount as 5 ether.
```solidity
   function lockETH(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint256 amount
    ) external payable onlyRole(0) {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;

        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
 ==>       _ethLocked += amount;  // @audit 5 Ether is accounted as received in global state
 ==>       _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount; // @audit 5 Ether is accounted as received against the raffle.

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```

3. Post the call, _ethLocked is 5 Ether and  _ethRaffles[raffleId]  is also 5 Ether

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker has 1 Ether to initiate the transaction


### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `lockETH()` with 5 Ether in Amount as parameter, while sending 1 Ether in msg.value
2. Admin calls `withdrawETH()` which will result in revert due to underflow as `_ethLocked` will be greater than `balance`.

```solidity
    function withdrawETH(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        uint256 availableBalance;
->       unchecked { availableBalance = balance - _ethLocked; } // @audit, this line will result in revert
        if (availableBalance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
``` 

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `lockETH(...)`, ensure that parameter `amount` is equal to `msg.value` during the execution of the function.


```solidity
    function lockETH(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint256 amount
    ) external payable onlyRole(0) {
+     require(msg.value == amount, "ether sent did not match");
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;

        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
        _ethLocked += amount;
        _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```
