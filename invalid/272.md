# WinnablesTicketManager.sol#_checkShouldCancel - Wrong check allows raffle to be canceled even though it shouldn't be

## Summary
Wrong check allows a raffle to be canceled even though it shouldn't be.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are allowed to cancel a raffle with `cancelRaffle` and return their money. A raffle can be canceled if three conditions are met:
- the raffle status is IDLE
- the raffle ended
- the raffle supply is **LESS** than the minimum allowed. 

These checks are done inside `_checkShouldCancel`:
```js
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return; // pass
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle(); // pass 
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen(); // pass
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```
As we can see, the last if checks that the `supply` is more than the `minTicketsThreshold`. If that's true, the cancellation is not allowed and it will revert. However, if the `supply` is equal to the `minTicketsThreshold` this check will pass and the raffle can be canceled. The problem is, if the `supply` is equal to the `minTicketsThreshold` the raffle is eligible and should not be canceled.

## Impact
Wrong check allows a raffle to be canceled even though it shouldn't be.

        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
-        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
+        if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
