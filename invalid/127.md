# Nobody can mint Tickets in `WinnablesTicket::mint()`

### Summary

The [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182) function has access controls of `onlyRole(1)`, which the calling contract `WinnablesTicketManager` is not setUp with.

### Root Cause

The Role(1) used in the onlyRole() modifier

### Internal pre-conditions

Anytime `WinnablesTicketManager` makes a call to `WinnablesTicket::mint()`

### External pre-conditions

Anytime user calls `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets()`

### Attack Path

[`WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182-L210) does not have any access controls meaning anyone can buy a ticket but anytime a user tries to buy tickets, vulnerability will occur.

### Impact

Users can't buy tickets because `mint()` will always revert thereby defying one of the main invariants of the protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
    if (to == address(0)) {
      revert TransferToAddressZero();
    }
...
}
```
function requires msg.sender of role(1), However the calling contract is not setup with that role so it will revert.

### Mitigation

Re-check the implementation of the access controls on the `mint()` function.
