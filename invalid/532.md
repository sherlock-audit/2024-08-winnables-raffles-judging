# M-05 Potential DoS Due to Gas Limit in Refund Function

### Summary

The refundPlayers function in the WinnablesTicketManager contract processes refunds for participants in a canceled raffle by iterating over a list of participants. However, the function does not account for the potential gas limit issues that may arise when the players array is large. This can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where the transaction fails due to out-of-gas errors, leaving participants unable to receive their refunds.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the function's design, which processes all refunds in a single transaction by iterating through the entire players array. If the number of participants is large, the transaction may exceed the block gas limit, causing it to fail. This failure prevents any refunds from being processed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The raffle status is RaffleStatus.CANCELED.
2. The players array contains a large number of participants.
3. The function is called by an authorized user with the appropriate role.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The raffle is canceled, and the refundPlayers function is called with a large players array.
2. The function begins processing refunds but runs out of gas due to the large number of participants.
3. The transaction fails, preventing any refunds from being processed.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is significant, as it can result in a situation where no participants in a canceled raffle are refunded. This creates a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for the participants, leading to a loss of trust in the platform and potential financial losses for the affected users. Additionally, the contract's operations could be disrupted if the refunds cannot be processed, leading to further complications and delays.

### PoC

1. The raffle is canceled, and there are 10,000 participants in the players array.
2. The refundPlayers function is called to process the refunds.
3. The function runs out of gas while iterating through the players array, causing the transaction to fail.
4. As a result, no participants are refunded, and the function cannot be successfully executed.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing a batching mechanism that processes refunds in smaller groups or allows participants to claim their refunds individually. This approach would prevent the transaction from exceeding the block gas limit and ensure that refunds can be processed even for large participant lists.
