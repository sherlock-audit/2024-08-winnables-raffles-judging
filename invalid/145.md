# Withdraw tokens revert due to wrong check

## Summary
Wrong check for the amount of ERC20 tokens on `withdrawTokens` will make the function revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` the `withdrawTokens` function checks if the amount to withdraw is less than the token balance.  This will always be true and will make the function revert.
## Impact
`WinnablesTicketManager.sol::withdrawTokens` will always revert.

## Code Snippet

```jsx
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
@>        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff

function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {

	IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
	uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-   if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
+   if (balance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
	token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}

```
