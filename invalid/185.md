# Reentrancy in Prize Manager will alow a raffle winner to drain the protocol

## Summary

Several flaws in the code of the Prize Manager will allow a raffle winner to drain the whole contract, when claiming ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize()` function, let's take a look at it:

```javascript
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        ...
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }

function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
        (bool success, ) = winner.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }    
```

`_ethLocked` is a state variable which stores the total ETH for all ETH raffles and the `_ethRaffles[raffleId]` mapping is stores the prize amount. There are several flaws which allow a reentrancy attack on the contract:

1. Lack of reentrancy guard
2. The subtraction of the prize amount from `_ethLocked` is in `unchecked{}` scope, which will not revert on underflow
3. The raffle prize status is set as `CLAIMED` only after the interaction with the winner

Here is a scenario, performing the attack:

1. Raffle admin locks 5 ether in raffles 1 and 2 as prize amount, so `ethLocked` will increase to 10 ether and `_ethRaffles[1]`, `_ethRaffles[2]` will have stored 5 ether each:

```javascript
function lockETH(address ticketManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId, uint256 amount) external payable onlyRole(0) {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;

        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
        _ethLocked += amount;
        _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```
2. The raffle winner participates using a smart contract and in a loop implements a call to `claimPrize()` in it's `receive()` function
3. The attacker calls `claimPrize()`, which calls `_sendETHPrize`, which triggers the fallback function and reenters `claimPrize()` again
4. The state variables update is as follows: 
   - first enter `_ethLocked` -= `ethRaffles[1]` -> 10 - 5 = 5 ether
   - second enter `_ethLocked` -= `ethRaffles[1]` -> 5 - 5 = 0 ether
   - third enter ... `_ethLocked` will underflow and because of the `unchecked` keyword will not revert, thus attacker takes full control of the calls

## Impact

- High: a malicious ETH raffle winner can drain the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the following recommendations for full protection from such attack:

1. Implement a reentrancy guard
2. Follow CEI pattern, and set the `CLAIMED` status in the beginning
3. Remove the `unchecked{}` keyword in the subtraction
4. Optionally, to not allow users utilizing smart contracts to participate
