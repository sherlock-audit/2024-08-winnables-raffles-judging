# raffle is both drawable and cancelable when currentTicketSold = minTicketsThreshold

## Summary

Now there's a game-theory issue in the protocol: a raffle is both drawable and cancelable when `currentTicketSold = minTicketsThreshold`. This issue enables an attacker to force cancel a lottery that should have drawn results

## Vulnerability Detail

`WinnablesTicketManager.sol`:

```solidity
    function _checkTicketPurchaseable(uint256 raffleId, uint256 ticketCount) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.start sAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleHasNotStarted(); 
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert RaffleHasEnded();
        if (block.timestamp > raffle.endsAt) revert RaffleHasEnded();
        uint256 ticketPurchased = uint256(uint32(uint256(raffle.participations[msg.sender]) >> 128));
        unchecked {
            if (ticketPurchased + ticketCount > raffle.maxHoldings) revert TooManyTickets();
        }
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            if (supply + ticketCount > raffle.maxTicketSupply) revert TooManyTickets();
        }
    }

    function _checkShouldDraw(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        uint256 currentTicketSold = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (currentTicketSold == 0) revert NoParticipants();

        if (block.timestamp < raffle.endsAt) {
            if (currentTicketSold < raffle.maxTicketSupply) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        }
        if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
    }

    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```

From the logic above, we can conclude that:

1. when `block.timestamp >= raffle.endsAt`, the raffle is both drawable and cancelable.
2. when `currentTicketSold == minTicketsThreshold`, the raffle is both drawable and cancelable.

In terms of game theory, we are in an awkward situation -- A raffle that should have been cancelled can be drawn, a raffle that should have been drawn can be cancelled. This means that an attacker can deprive participants' right to earn a reward by calling `cancelRaffle`.

## Impact

impact: medium - A raffle that should have been cancelled can be drawn, a raffle that should have been drawn can be cancelled.

likelihood: medium - this situation happens everytime when `currentTicketSold = minTicketsThreshold`.

Severity: boardline medium

## Recommendation

`shouldDrawRaffle` and `shouldCancelRaffle` should never return true at same time.
