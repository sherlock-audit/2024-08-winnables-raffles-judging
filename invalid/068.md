```solidity
    function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
        IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
    }
```
transferFrom is also used when admin withdraws NFT that is not locked in a raffle

```solidity
 function withdrawNFT(address nft, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(0) {
        if (_nftLocked[nft][tokenId]) revert NFTLocked();
        IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
    }

```
