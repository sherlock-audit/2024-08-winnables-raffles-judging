# Contract based accounts, such as AA, cannot claim winner prize

## Summary

The winner address on Ethereum and Avalanche have to be the same. Smart accounts or any other contract-based accounts that do not have the same address on both chains cannot claim their prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334) function on Avalanche forwards the winner's address to Ethereum, where the [`WinnablesPrizeManager::_ccipReceive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L275-L276) function declares the winner on Ethereum. However, smart accounts or contract-based accounts that do not have the same address on both chains cannot claim their prizes.

## Impact

Contract-based accounts that do not have the same address on both chains cannot claim their prizes.
