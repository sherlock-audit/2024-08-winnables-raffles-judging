# WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize does not follow CEI, leading to reentrancy attack

### Summary

The claimPrize function does not follow checks-effects-interactions and puts `afflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;` at the end of the function, transferring the funds first and then checking them, allowing the attacker to steal all the prizes in the contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L120-L122

In `claimPrize.sol:120-122` the check here should be at the beginning of the `claimPrize`  instead of at the end

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker used the contract address to participate in the raffle and became a winner

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A attacker uses a contract address (with reentrancy attack logic in the receive function) to participate in the raffle and become the winner
2. The attacker calls the WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize function, triggers the receive function, triggers a reentrancy attack, and steals all prize money

### Impact

All prizes in the contract are stolen by the attacker

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Follow CEI and put `claimPrize.sol:120-122` at the beginning of the claimPrize function instead of at the end
