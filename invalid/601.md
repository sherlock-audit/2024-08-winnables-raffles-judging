# Attackers can cancel raffles that reaches minTicketsThreshold due to using > instead of >=

## Summary
Attackers can cancel raffles that reaches minTicketsThreshold due to using > instead of >=

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of a raffle, users are able to draw winner also long as they reach the minTicketsThreshold as seen in the docs and code implementation:
```solidity
function _checkShouldDraw(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        ...
@>        if (currentTicketSold < raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsNotReached();
    }
```
however, attackers can still cancel raffles that reaches the minTicketsThreshold by canceling before the users `drawWinner()` call or frontrunning it, due to the check to prevent this uses > instead of >=:
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        ...
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
```

## Recommendation
```diff
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        ...
+       if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
-       if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
    }
