# The assumption of winner having same account address on ETH chain and AVAX chain can be wrong

### Summary

There is a possibility that a user is participating with a smart on-chain wallet where AVAX chain is supported but not ETH chain or their ETH wallet have different address. In this case the prize sent to winner on ETH chain can be unrecoverable as the winner won't be able to `claimPrize()` on ETH chain. There can be a claim period that allows owner to claim rewards on that case. So the rewards don't stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105` It is assumed that the winner address is same on both ETH and AVAX.

### Attack Path

1. Alice uses smart wallet provider to participate in raffle in AVAX chain.
2. If the smart wallet provider doesn't support ETH chain. If Alice wins the raffle it's rewards will be unrecoverable.

### Impact

Locking of user rewards in the contract

### Mitigation

There should be an option for winner on AVAX to provide their eligible ETH address for rewards. There should also be a claim period for the winner after which owner can unlock the rewards as to avoid them getting locked in the contract forever.
