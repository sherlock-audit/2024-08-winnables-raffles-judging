# last second raffle cancel

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Raffle bidders are allowed to bid at the last second of a raffle

```solidity
    function _checkTicketPurchaseable(uint256 raffleId, uint256 ticketCount) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.startsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleHasNotStarted();// check if raffle has started
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert RaffleHasEnded();// NONE, PRIZE_LOCKED, IDLE, REQUESTED, FULFILLED, PROPAGATED, CLAIMED, CANCELED
        if (block.timestamp > raffle.endsAt) revert RaffleHasEnded();// @< last second bid possible
```
Let's say raffle ends at second x. In case there are not enough bids to meet the min required amount for the raffle to be successful, there will be refunds. This is done by calling WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle(). Internally it validates if the raffle has ended.
if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) 
```solidity
    function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;// has not started yet
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();// raffle has started
        // check if raffle has ended or ends in curr block. If Active revert()
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();// @<
    }
```
As can be seen the last if statement checks:
`if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) `
However at the last second, there are still bids possible from other players, also the raffle can be canceled at the last second. Which means that a raffle participant can monitor the mempool, check at the last second if there will be enough bids way bigger than his own, which means that he can have much less chance of winning. Knowing this info he can cancel the raffle at the last second and get a refund

## Impact
Unfair refund for players who bid too small amount, fair players who bid bigger amount will not receive potential rewards, even though min required tickets was met.
