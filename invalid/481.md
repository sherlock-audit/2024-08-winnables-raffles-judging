# Incorrect minTickets Condition in WinnablesTicketManager::createRaffle May Prevent Raffle Functioning Correctly

### Summary

The missing validation in the _WinnablesTicketManager::createRaffle_ function will cause a logical inconsistency for the raffle contract as the condition where _minTickets_ is greater than _maxTickets_ will prevent the raffle from functioning correctly.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L252

### Root Cause

In the _createRaffle_ function, there is no check to ensure that _minTickets_ is less than or equal to _maxTickets_. This allows a situation where _minTickets_ can be set higher than _maxTickets_, which would make it impossible to meet the minimum ticket threshold required for the raffle to proceed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call _createRaffle(_) with _minTickets_ greater than _maxTickets_.
2. _maxTickets_ is set to a value less than _minTickets_ during the raffle creation.

### External pre-conditions

There are no specific external pre-conditions as this is an internal logic issue.

### Attack Path

1. The Admin or any authorized role calls _createRaffle()_ and sets _minTickets_ to a value greater than _maxTickets_.
2. The raffle is created, but since it is impossible to sell the required number of tickets (_minTickets_), the raffle cannot function as intended.

### Impact

The users or participants of the raffle will suffer as the raffle cannot proceed if the minimum ticket requirement cannot be met, effectively preventing any tickets from being sold or the raffle from completing. The protocol will fail to generate the expected revenue from the raffle.
