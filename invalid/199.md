# Admin can completely change the result of a raffle by minting free tickets

## Summary
Admin can completely change the result of a raffle by minting free tickets

## Vulnerability Detail
According to `ReadMe` of the contest
> Because we want to reserve the right to distribute free tickets to partners for marketing purposes, the admin can virtually mint out raffle tickets to addresses of their choice.

Also the main `principles` that must always remain `true` are(from ReadMe of the contest)
> Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

Now, the problem is admin can change the `winner`(which is already decided) by minting free tickets to addresses of their choice, which `breaks` the main principles of the protocol(stated above)

//Here is how this works
1. Suppose a raffle with Id = 1, whose 245 tickets are sold(it passes the criteria for drawWinner())
2. drawWinner() is called and suppose randomWord is 739 then winner will be 739 % 245 = 4 ie owner of ticketId = 4
3. Now admin virtually minted 1 free ticket, which means new tickedSupply = 246 & winner will be 739 % 246 = 1 ie owner of ticketId = 1
4. Then someone called propagateRaffleWinner() which sets owner of ticketId = 1 as winner in prizeManager.sol

## Impact
Admin can change the outcome/winner of a raffle, which breaks the main invariants of the protocol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are couple of recommendation
1. Don't allow virtual minting of tokens, instead let admin go through buyTickets()
