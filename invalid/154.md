# M-02 Incorrect Condition in `_checkShouldCancel` Function Allows for Improper Raffle Cancellation

### Summary

In the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, the `_checkShouldCancel()` function contains a logic error that could lead to the incorrect cancellation of a raffle. Specifically, the condition `if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();` does not account for cases where the number of tickets sold equals the minimum ticket threshold. This oversight may allow the cancellation of raffles that have met their required ticket sales, impacting both the `cancelRaffle` and `shouldCancelRaffle` functions.

### Root Cause

In the `_checkShouldCancel():434` function within the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract, the condition that checks if the number of tickets sold exceeds the minimum threshold is incorrect. The current check, `if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold)` on line 440 , should include the >= operator to prevent the cancellation of raffles that have exactly met the minimum ticket requirement.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A raffle is created with a specific `minTicketsThreshold`.
2. The raffle reaches exactly the `minTicketsThreshold`.
3. The `cancelRaffle` or `shouldCancelRaffle` function is called.

### External pre-conditions

1. Users participate in the raffle, bringing the ticket supply to exactly `minTicketsThreshold`.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `cancelRaffle()`.
2. The `_checkShouldCancel` function is invoked.
3. The raffle may have sold exactly the number of tickets required `(supply == minTicketsThreshold)`.
4. The function erroneously identifies that the minimum ticket threshold has not been reached because the condition only checks if supply is greater than `>` the threshold, not if it is equal to `>=`.
5. The raffle is incorrectly flagged for cancellation, even though it has met the minimum requirements.
6. The raffle is canceled, and users are refunded, despite the raffle having reached the ticket goal.

### Impact

The incorrect logic in `_checkShouldCancel` results in the premature and unintended cancellation of raffles that have met the required ticket threshold. This could lead to user frustration as raffles they participated in are canceled despite meeting the minimum criteria, leading to potential financial and reputational damage for the platform.

Additionally, the platform might incur unnecessary costs due to these incorrect cancellations, as funds are refunded when they should have been held, leading to potential financial instability and a loss of user trust in the platformâ€™s functionality.

### PoC

1. Assume a raffle is created with a `minTicketsThreshold` of 100 tickets.
2. Users purchase exactly 100 tickets, meeting the `minTicketsThreshold`.
3. he raffle reaches its end time `endsAt < block.timestamp`.
4.  A user calls `cancelRaffle()` to check if the raffle should be canceled.
5.  `_checkShouldCancel` checks the condition if `supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold` and finds that `supply == 100`, which does not satisfy the `>` condition.
6.  The function fails to recognize that the minimum threshold is met, and thus incorrectly allows the raffle to be canceled.

### Mitigation

Update the condition in `_checkShouldCancel` on line 440 as follows:
```solidity
if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
```
