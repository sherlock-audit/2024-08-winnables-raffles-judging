# Account Abstraction Wallets are unable to claim rewards

## Summary

Account Abstraction Wallets have different addresses on different chains. This can cause problems in protocols which use two or more mainnets for functionality. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol works by selling tickets on the Avalanche mainnet through the `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contract and upon completion of the raffle, a winner is selected by utilizing VRF's fulfillRandomWords() functon. Once the winner has been drawn, anyone can call the function propagateRaffleWinner() which sends a _ccipMessage to the Prize Manager where the prizes are locked, this contract is on the Ethereum mainnet.

Upon purchasing tickets the user's address is stored on the avalanche mainnet, once the winner has been found, the _ccip forwards the message to prize manager and forwards the address of the winner from the avalanche mainnet. 

But the winner can be different address on ethereum hence locking them out of receiving their reward

## Impact

AA wallets are unable to receive their rewards
