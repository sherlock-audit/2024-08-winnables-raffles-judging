# Admin Can Decide Who Will Be The Winner

## Summary

Admins are trusted roles , but they come with certain conditions as mentioned in the README ->

* Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize
* Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded
* Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

But , the admin can control who will be the winner as explained below.


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Let's assume users have bought tickets , and chainlink VRF has sent the random number which is assigned to `request.randomWord = randomWords[0];`

2.) At this point everyone knows which ticket will be the winner , since the random number has been assigned. Our admin sees this and decides this is not the winner he wants.

3.) Before the winner or anyone could call `propagateRaffleWinner()` ( via frontrunninf for example) , the admin sets his malicious counterpart as a valid counterpart (using `setCCIPCounterpart()` ) and sends a message to the prize manager contract with his choice of winner in the message data.

4.) The winner gets assigned to admin's winner choice here ->

5.) The new winner calls claimPrize() and claims the prize locked in prize manager ,

## Impact

The admin can control the winner and the real winner would loose his prize , violating the truth that should be held
