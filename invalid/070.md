# Blacklisted raffle may cause impacted raffle to be non-refundable

### Summary

If the `WinnablesPrizeManager` becomes blacklisted (USDC and USDT both have blacklists) and the number of tickets bought reaches the `WinnablesTicketManager.minTicketsThreshold`, then the winner (if there is one) will not be able to claim the prize and the prize manager will not allow refunds.

In the contest discord the head of judging has stated that with regard to blacklists `For tokens that have a blacklist, we will ignore any issues caused by that blacklist unless they cause damage to the protocol or other users.` and this affects the functioning of the protocol as well as the users.

### Root Cause

USDC and USDT both have blacklists that may blacklist the `WinnablesPrizeManager`, locking those tokens there. Once the tickets bought reaches the `raffle.minTicketsThreshold`, [WinnablesTicketManager.sol:440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L440) will prevent refunds from being given for the broken raffle.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A token raffle is created with either a USDC or USDT prize
2. `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` tickets have been sold

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. The token (USDC or USDT) uses its blacklist to blacklist the `WinnablesPrizeManager`'s address

### Impact

Any winner will be unable to [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L309) due to the blacklist, and the same will be true of [withdrawTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L296). Because the `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` has been reached the raffle also cannot be [canceled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L440) so no [refunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L217) can be given and the ticket holders will lose the money they paid in return for nothing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the winner to initiate cancellation
