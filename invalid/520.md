# No check if `minTickets` is less than `maxTickets`

## Summary
No check if `minTickets` is less than `maxTickets` in `createRaffle`
## Vulnerability Detail
After diving into the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` we can see that there is a function called `createRaffle`:
```solidity
    /// @notice (Admin) Create NFT Raffle for an prize NFT previously sent to this contract
    /// @param raffleId ID Of the raffle shared with the remote chain
    /// @param startsAt Epoch timestamp in seconds of the raffle start time
    /// @param endsAt Epoch timestamp in seconds of the raffle end time
    /// @param minTickets Minimum number of tickets required to be sold for this raffle
    /// @param maxHoldings Maximum number of tickets one player can hold
    function createRaffle(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint64 startsAt,
        uint64 endsAt,
        uint32 minTickets,
        uint32 maxTickets,
        uint32 maxHoldings
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        _checkRaffleTimings(startsAt, endsAt);
        if (maxTickets == 0) revert RaffleRequiresTicketSupplyCap();
        if (maxHoldings == 0) revert RaffleRequiresMaxHoldings();
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) revert PrizeNotLocked();

        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.IDLE;
        raffle.startsAt = startsAt;
        raffle.endsAt = endsAt;
        raffle.minTicketsThreshold = minTickets;
        raffle.maxTicketSupply = maxTickets;
        raffle.maxHoldings = maxHoldings;

        emit NewRaffle(raffleId);
    }
```
It is obvious by the name and also from the *NatSpec* that it creates a new raffle. However, one of the required parameters called `minTickets` which is then set to `raffle.minTicketsThreshold` is not checked if it is smaller than the max supply `maxTickets`. It means that this raffle will never have a winner because when the time runs out the minimum tickets cannot be satisfied.
## Impact
A raffle which cannot have a winner can be created.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add an `if` statement checking if `minTickets` is less than the max supply or `maxTickets`. If it is then revert.
```solidity
if (minTickets > maxTickets) {
// ...
}
```
