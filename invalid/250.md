# Stuck of funds if Chainlink VRF does not respond for a long time

## Summary
Stuck of funds if Chainlink VRF does not respond for a long time.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can participate in a raffle by buying tickets and later, one of all participants will win the raffle. To choose the winner, the protocol user Chainlink VRF `requestRandomWords`. Once randomness is requested, the Chainlink should respond with a random number as a result to determine the winner of a Raffle. However, it is a problem because the Chainlink response can be delayed, it can take few seconds but it can also take more than 10 minutes. The worst possible scenario is if the Chainlink VRF is down. 

Thus, no winner can be chosen, users must wait for an indefinite period of time with their money stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Stuck of funds if Chainlink VRF does not respond for a long time.
