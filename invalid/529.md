# Wrong check in withdrawTokens() does not allow tokens withdraw

## Summary
Wrong check in WinnablesTicketManager.sol - withdrawTokens() function, does not allow tokens withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail
```jsx
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
If we have amount lower than the balance, the function is going to revert. In case it should revert, when the amount is bigger than the balance - when the balance is not enough.
## Impact
Funds will be stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The condition in the withdrawTokens() function should be corrected to ensure that the transaction only reverts if the amount to be withdrawn exceeds the contract's balance. This will prevent funds from being stuck and ensure that withdrawals can be executed as intended.
if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
