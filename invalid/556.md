# shouldDrawRaffle Function Always Returns True Due to Reverts in Internal Check

### Summary

The _shouldDrawRaffle_ function is intended to determine whether a raffle should proceed to draw a winner based on certain conditions. However, the function currently always returns _true_. This issue arises because the function calls an internal helper function, __checkShouldDraw_, which performs various checks but does not affect the return value of _shouldDrawRaffle_. Consequently, _shouldDrawRaffle_ does not accurately reflect whether the raffle conditions for drawing a winner are satisfied.

### Root Cause

The _shouldDrawRaffle_ function is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether a raffle should proceed with drawing a winner. However, the function relies on __checkShouldDraw_, which performs internal checks and reverts with errors if conditions are not met, rather than returning a boolean value. Due to this design, _shouldDrawRaffle_ always returns true, regardless of the actual raffle state or conditions.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The always-true return value from _shouldDrawRaffle_ means that users will not be able to accurately determine if a raffle is eligible to draw a winner based on its actual state. This is caused because because the transaction reverts. This could lead to:

- Misleading information about the raffleâ€™s status.
- Incorrect handling or processing of raffles.
- Potential operational issues or user dissatisfaction due to inaccuracies in raffle management.
