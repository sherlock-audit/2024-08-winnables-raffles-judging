# WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize does not follow CEI, leading to reentrancy attacks

### Summary

The claimPrize function does not follow checks-effects-interactions. The following code is placed at the end of the function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L103-L124
which performs the operation of transferring money first and then checking. This allows the attacker to claim the reward from the contract multiple times.
```solidity
if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
 rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```

### Root Cause

In `claimPrize.sol:120-122` 
This check should be placed at the beginning of the claimPrize function

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker used the contract address to participate in the raffle and became the winnerThe attacker used the contract address to participate in the raffle and became the winnerThe attacker used the contract address to participate in the raffle and became the winner

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.A malicious attacker can use a contract address (insert a reentrancy attack code in the receive function) to participate in the raffle and become the winner.
2.Malicious attackers call the WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize function, which automatically triggers the receive function, causing a reentrancy attack and allowing the attacker to claim the prize multiple times.

### Impact

Malicious attackers use reentry attacks to claim reward multiple times

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Following CEI, put the following code at the beginning of the claimPrize function
```solidity
if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```
