# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `claimPrize` Function

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability arises due to the function's execution flow, where state changes (specifically updating the raffle status and the _ethLocked balance) occur after the transfer of ETH to the winner. An attacker can exploit this by re-entering the claimPrize function during the ETH transfer, allowing them to claim more ETH than they are entitled to.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:

* The contract has 6 ETH locked in `_ethLocked`, and Alice is the winner of a raffle with a prize of 2 ETH.
* Alice calls the claimPrize function with the raffle ID.
* `_sendETHPrize` transfers 2 ETH to Alice's address. If Alice controls a contract that triggers a fallback function or re-enters claimPrize during this transfer, she can re-call claimPrize before the state is fully updated.
* Aliceâ€™s re-entry would see the contract still having 4 ETH available and the raffle prize status unchanged, allowing her to claim additional ETH.

## Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to claim more ETH by re-entering the claimPrize function, the attacker can claim more ETH than the prize amount designated for the raffle. Also, excessive claiming can lead to unintended fund loss from the contract, impacting its financial stability and trustworthiness.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls to the claimPrize function.
