# Reentrancy and underflow vulnerabilities in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize`, leading to loss of funds

### Summary

Missing CEI / Reentrancy guard checks in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` could lead to a reentrancy attack, which allows an attacker to reenter the function and claim the same prize multiple times. This vulnerability can also lead to underflow issues in the contract’s accounting variables, causing incorrect and potentially exploitable state values. If exploited, these vulnerabilities can result in significant financial loss for the contract.

### Root Cause

1. The function updates the contract's state variables (such as `rafflePrize.status`) [**after**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L121) making external calls to send prizes (NFTs, tokens, or Ether).
2. The use of `unchecked` arithmetic allows for the possibility of underflow (link to code [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L114) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L117)) if the function is reentered and the variables are decremented multiple times.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The contract must have a mapping or state variables managing the raffle’s prize information (`_rafflePrize`, `_nftRaffles`, `_tokenRaffles`, `_ethRaffles`).
- The state variables `_tokensLocked` or `_ethLocked` track the locked assets for the raffle.
- The prize status (`rafflePrize.status`) is initially set to an unclaimed state (e.g., `RafflePrizeStatus.UNCLAIMED`).

### External pre-conditions

- The attacker must be the winner of the raffle, allowing them to call the `claimPrize` function.
- The attacker must deploy a contract with a fallback or receive function capable of reentering the `claimPrize` function.
- The external call (e.g., sending Ether or tokens) must trigger this fallback or receive function, enabling the reentrancy.

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy Malicious Contract:** The attacker deploys a contract with a receive function that calls back into the `claimPrize` function on the vulnerable contract.

2. **Call `claimPrize`:** The attacker calls the `claimPrize` function, triggering the transfer of a prize.

3. **Reenter `claimPrize`:** The `fallback` or `receive` function in the malicious contract reenters the `claimPrize` function before the prize status is updated to CLAIMED.

4. **Repeat:** The process repeats, allowing the attacker to claim the prize multiple times before the state is updated.

5. **Underflow:** The repeated decrements of `_tokensLocked` or `_ethLocked` cause these variables to underflow, potentially leading to incorrect state values and further exploitation.

### Impact

- **Multiple Claims:** The attacker can claim the same prize multiple times, draining the contract of its assets.
- **Underflow:** The contract’s state variables can underflow, leading to incorrect values and distorted accounting.
- **Financial Loss:** The contract may lose more assets than it should, resulting in significant financial loss.

### PoC

1. Example of Malicious Contract:

```solidity
interface IRaffle {
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external;
}

contract ReentrancyAttack {
    IRaffle raffleContract;
    uint256 targetRaffleId;

    constructor(address _raffleContract, uint256 _raffleId) {
        raffleContract = IRaffle(_raffleContract);
        targetRaffleId = _raffleId;
    }

    // Fallback function to reenter the claimPrize function
    receive() external payable {
        // Reentering claimPrize function
        raffleContract.claimPrize(targetRaffleId);
    }

    function attack() external {
        // Initiate the first claimPrize call
        raffleContract.claimPrize(targetRaffleId);
    }
}

```

2. Attack Execution:
- Deploy the `ReentrancyAttack` contract with the address of the vulnerable raffle contract and the ID of the target raffle.
- Call the attack function on the `ReentrancyAttack` contract to initiate the first claim.
- The reentrancy occurs as the malicious contract’s `receive` function is triggered by the prize transfer, allowing multiple claims.


### Mitigation

1. **State update before external calls:** Update the contract state (e.g., setting rafflePrize.status to CLAIMED) before making any external calls, such as transferring prizes.

2. **Use ReentrancyGuard:** Implement OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy by using a non-reentrant modifier.
