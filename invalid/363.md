# Out of gas when determining raffle winner

### Summary

There will potentially be an out of gas issue when determining the raffle winner, because the ownerOf function in `WinnablesTicket` uses naive iteration over binary search. 

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicket.sol`, the ownerOf function looks like the following:

```solidity
    function ownerOf(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 ticketId
    ) public view returns (address) {
        // @audit: this is clearly a massive grief b/c gas / time complexity
        if (ticketId >= _supplies[id]) {
            revert InexistentTicket();
        }
        while (_ticketOwnership[id][ticketId] == address(0)) {
            unchecked {
                --ticketId;
            }
        }
        return _ticketOwnership[id][ticketId];
    }
```

Let's say that someone has bought an extremely high (`10^9`) number of tickets, and they have won the prize. In this case, we will have to iterate through potentially `10^9` values and access the _ticketOwnership mapping before we are able to determine the owner. This takes way more than the block gas limit of `15000000` on Avalanche. Even at a much lower number of tickets (e.g. a couple million), this would be extremely problematic. 

This has many upstream effects; for example, this can cause out of gas in `propagateRaffleWinner` in `WinnablesTicketManager` which needs to determine the winner and then send a CCIP message, leading to breakage of core protocol functionality and loss of prize for the winner. `propagateRaffleWinner` uses `_getWinnerByRequestId` which uses the above `ownerOf` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The winner is someone who bought a lot of tickets, so a lot of iterations are required for the ownerOf function

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Breakage of core protocol functionality since winner cannot be determined with the given gas and therefore cannot be communicated to the L1 through CCIP
2. Loss of ability for the winner to claim prize

### PoC

```javascript

it('Demonstration of gas issues', async () => {
      await (await ticket.setRole(signers[0].address, 1, true)).wait();
      const { events } = await (await ticket.mint(signers[1].address, 1, 100000000)).wait();
      const drawWinnerReceipt = await (await manager.drawWinner(1)).wait();
      const { requestId } = drawWinnerReceipt.events[1].args;
      await (await coordinator.fulfillRandomWordsWithOverride(requestId, manager.address, [randomWord()])).wait();
      expect(await manager.getWinner(1)).to.eq(signers[1].address);
})

```
