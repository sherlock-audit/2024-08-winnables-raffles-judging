# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721s out of the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(), which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:
- [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)  discourages the use of transferFrom(); use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible
- The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom(). A notable example of such contracts is the Sudoswap pair:
```solidity
function onERC721Received(
  address,
  address,
  uint256 id,
  bytes memory
) public virtual returns (bytes4) {
  IERC721 _nft = nft();
  // If it's from the pair's NFT, add the ID to ID set
  if (msg.sender == address(_nft)) {
	idSet.add(id);
  }
  return this.onERC721Received.selector;
}
```
It helps ensure that the recipient is indeed capable of handling ERC721s.

## Impact
There is the potential loss of NFTs should the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.
