# The protocol does not support rebased tokens

### Summary

When using a rebased token as a prize, there may be insufficient funds due to a decrease in the token balance, and the `claimPrize` function may not be able to run, causing funds to be stuck in the [WinnablesPrizeManager ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105)contract.

### Root Cause

WinnablesPrizeManager does not consider rebased tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

Use the rebased token as the prize.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

As stated in the [documentation](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/516), the protocol supports any ERC20. But rebasing tokens are not actually taken into account, so this is a missing feature. It may cause the prize to be unable to be transferred out and get stuck, or there may be remaining prizes.
