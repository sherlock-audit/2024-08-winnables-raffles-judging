# any player from the list of refunded players can make the refundPlayers function revert

## Summary
Any player from the list of players can make the `refundPlayers` revert

## Vulnerability Detail
`WinnablesTicketManager.sol::refundPlayers` loops over the players array and refunds ETH. If any of the players don't accept the refunded ETH (e.g revert on receive function) the entire `refundPlayers` will revert and other players won't be able to get their ETH

## Impact
Players won't be refunded

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function refundPlayers(uint256 raffleId, address[] calldata players) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; ) {
            address player = players[i];
            uint256 participation = uint256(raffle.participations[player]);
            if (((participation >> 160) & 1) == 1) revert PlayerAlreadyRefunded(player);
            raffle.participations[player] = bytes32(participation | (1 << 160));
            uint256 amountToSend = (participation & type(uint128).max);
     @>       _sendETH(amountToSend, player);
            emit PlayerRefund(raffleId, player, bytes32(participation));
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
    }
```
```solidity
 function _sendETH(uint256 amount, address to) internal {
        if (amount == 0) revert NothingToSend();
        (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
