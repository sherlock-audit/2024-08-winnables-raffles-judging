# Unauthorized Prize Claim Due to Premature Asset Transfer in claimPrize Function

# Summary

The `claimPrize` function in the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract contains a critical vulnerability where the prize (NFT, TOKEN, or ETH) is transferred to the caller before verifying their status as the legitimate winner. This flaw could allow unauthorized users to claim prizes, potentially leading to significant asset loss for the protocol.

# Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is present in the [`claimPrize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L103-L125) function of the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. The function transfers the prize to `msg.sender` before performing crucial authorization checks. 

The vulnerability stems from the order of operations:

1. The prize is transferred to `msg.sender`.
2. The function checks if `msg.sender` is the actual winner.
3. The function checks if the prize has already been claimed.

This sequence allows an attacker to receive the prize before the authorization checks are performed.

# Impact

- Unauthorized Prize Claims: Any user could potentially claim prizes they didn't win, leading to direct asset loss for the protocol.
- Duplicate Claims: The legitimate winner might be unable to claim their prize if an attacker claims it first.
- Trust and Reputation Damage: Such a vulnerability could severely damage the protocol's reputation and user trust.

Manual Review

# Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the function should be restructured to perform all necessary checks before transferring any assets - "check-effects-interactions‚Äù. Here's a recommended fix:

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    
    // Perform checks first
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
    
    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;

    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
        _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
        _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
        unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
        _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
        _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();

    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```
