# Lack of ticket price validation allows arbitrary ticket purchases

## Summary

`WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` does not validate if the sent ETH (`msg.value`) is sufficient for the number of tickets being purchased. This oversight allows users to potentially buy tickets at an arbitrarily low price.

## Vulnerability Detail

While the documentation states that ticket pricing is handled off-chain, the contract implementation allows users with the appropriate role to directly call the `WinnablesTicketManager::buyTickets` function without enforcing the expected price. This discrepancy between the documented off-chain price management and the on-chain implementation (which requires users' input of funds via the `payable` function) creates a vulnerability where users can potentially purchase tickets at arbitrary prices.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to purchase tickets at a fraction of their intended cost or even for free. This would allow them to:

- Unfairly increase their chances of winning the raffle without paying the full price.
- Manipulate the raffle economics, potentially making it unprofitable for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a price check in the `WinnablesTicketManager::_checkTicketPurchaseable` function:

```diff
function _checkTicketPurchaseable(uint256 raffleId, uint256 ticketCount) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.startsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleHasNotStarted();
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert RaffleHasEnded();
    if (block.timestamp > raffle.endsAt) revert RaffleHasEnded();
+   if(msg.value < raffle.pricePerTicket * ticketCount) revert InsufficientPayment();

    // the rest of the function...
}
```
