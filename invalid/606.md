# Users using multisigs or AA wallets would lose their raffle prize

## Summary

Different contracts have different addresses on different chains. Currently, the prize manager is deployed on Ethereum and the ticket manager on avalanche. A user participating in a raffle on Avalanche using a multisig or AA wallet contract implementation would not be owning the same address on Ethereum. Due to this, the rewards would be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

When propagateRaffleWinner() is called, it uses the avalanche address i.e. the owner of the Winnable ticket purchased. If the winner is an multisig or AA wallet, then it would not have the same address on the destination chain, thus causing the rewards to be lost and locked in the contract. Someone else could claim that prize as well if they own that address on ethereum. 


As we can see in the code snippets below, the winner is set to the owner of the winning ticket number id purchased and sent along with the data for the cross-chain call to Ethereum, where the reward would be claimable by an address not owned by the actual multisig owner.
```solidity
  function _getWinnerByRequestId(uint256 requestId) internal view returns(address) {
        RequestStatus storage request = _chainlinkRequests[requestId];
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(request.raffleId);
        uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply;
        return IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).ownerOf(request.raffleId, winningTicketNumber);
    }
```

```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);


        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```
