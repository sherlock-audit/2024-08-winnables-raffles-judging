# Users cannot track ticket transfers because no transfer event is emitted upon transferring tickets to buyer

### Summary

The `WinnablesTicket::mint` function attempts to emit a TransferSingle event when tickets are minted and transferred to a buyer using the line [emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L196). However, this event is not defined in the contract, meaning that the intended action of logging the transfer is not properly recorded on the blockchain. This lack of an event can create issues for tracking ticket transfers and monitoring the contract’s activities.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that the `TransferSingle` event is referenced in the `WinnablesTicket::mint` function, but it has not been defined in the contract. This leads to a situation where the contract tries to emit an event that doesn’t exist, resulting in an undefined event being logged.


### Internal pre-conditions

The `WinnablesTicket::mint` function is called to mint and transfer tickets to a buyer.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This issue does not present a direct attack vector but instead creates a lack of transparency and traceability. Implications include difficulty in tracking the transfer of tickets, and misleading behavior for users or systems that rely on event logs for notifications or data updates, such as Winnables own front-end.


### Impact

The absence of the `TransferSingle` event impacts the transparency and traceability of ticket transfers within the `WinnablesTicket` contract. It may hinder the ability to keep track of transfers and complicate interactions with off-chain systems that depend on event logs to process data or trigger actions.


### PoC

The test below, which is an edited version of [this existing test](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/test/TicketManager.js#L438-L456), shows that the event is emitted as undefined:

```javascript
    it('Good ERC1155Receiver can purchase tickets', async () => {
      const currentBlock = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
      const sig = await api.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint16', 'uint256', 'uint256'], [
          goodReceiver.address,
          0,
          1,
          10,
          currentBlock + 10,
          0
        ])
      ));
      const tx = await whileImpersonating(goodReceiver.address, ethers.provider, async (signer) =>
        manager.connect(signer).buyTickets(1, 10, currentBlock + 10, sig)
      );
      const { events } = await tx.wait();
      expect(events).to.have.lengthOf(3);
@>    const transferSingleEvent = events.find(event => event.event === 'TransferSingle');
@>    expect(transferSingleEvent).to.be.undefined;
      expect(await tickets.balanceOf(goodReceiver.address, 1)).to.eq(10);
    });
```


### Mitigation

Define the TransferSingle event in the contract, e.g. on [`IWinnablesTicket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IWinnablesTicket.sol#L20-L21):

```Diff
  event NewTicket(uint256 indexed id, uint256 indexed startId, uint256 indexed amount);
+ event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
```
