# Classic Reentrancy in `claimPrize`

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in the contract allows a raffle winner to claim their prize. However, in the case where the prize is ETH, the function transfers ETH to the winner before updating the internal state. This violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, exposing the contract to a reentrancy attack. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly call the function and drain the contract's ETH balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimPrize` function handles the distribution of prizes to raffle winners. In the case of ETH prizes, contract sends the ETH to the winner before reducing the winners amount (`_ethRaffles[raffleId]`):
```solidity
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
```

Or changing the raffle's status to `CLAIMED` which currently done in the last line (after sending the ETH to the user).
Here's the relevant code snippet:
```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
		.
		.
		.
		else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } 
		.
		.
		.
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
```
This allows the msg.sender to reenter to the contract and steal all the deposited ETH.

## Impact
A malicious user could perform a reentrancy attack and drain the contract of its ETH balance, leading to significant financial loss for the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this vulnerability, the contract should follow the CEI pattern. The internal state (such as the raffle's status) should be updated before sending ETH to the winner. Hereâ€™s a suggested fix:

```diff
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
+       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
+       rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
		.
		.
		.
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        }
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```
By updating the winner's status before sending ETH, the risk of reentrancy attacks is mitigated.
