# User can possess all tickets in a raffle due to unexistent checks in WinnablesTicketManager

### Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L189

In _checkTicketPurchaseable() the number of tickets being purchased is checked against raffle.maxHoldings to prevent a user from posessing all tickets in a raffle and undoubtedly winning it. However, the check fails to account for the situation where the number of tickets purchased by the user is less than **maxHoldings** but equal to **minTickes**. Meaning the user purchased an acceptable number of tickets, the minimum threshold for tickets purchased is met and the raffle can therefore end with the user as the only participant, therefore winning the raffle unanimously.

### Root Cause

**- Failure to check minTickets against maxHoldings**

### Internal pre-conditions

**_Assume Everything Is Working Correctly_**

### External pre-conditions

**_Assume every external condition is working as should_**

### Attack Path

1. Owner Creates raffle with minTickets=n and MaxHoldings=n
2. User buys n tickets
3. Time passes, no one else participates and winner is drawn
4. User definitely wins as he is the only participant.


### Impact

Raffle stops being a raffle as user wins undoubtedly.

### PoC

POC 

```solidity
@notice: some modifications have been made to assume ccip and signature api is working as it should.
function testUserCanOwnAllTicketsInARaffle() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        
        //create raffle with minTickets=3 and MaxHoldings=3
        winnablesTicketManager.createRaffle(0, uint64(block.timestamp), uint64(block.timestamp+ 60) , 3, 5, 3);
        winnablesTicket.setRole(address(winnablesTicketManager), 1, true);

        vm.deal(address(3), 10e18);
        vm.startPrank(address(3));

        console.log(address(3).balance);

        bytes memory signature = "";
        winnablesTicketManager.buyTickets{value: 5e18}(0, 1, 0, signature);

        winnablesTicketManager.buyTickets{value: 2e18}(0, 1, 0, signature);

        winnablesTicketManager.buyTickets{value: 1e18}(0, 1, 0, signature);
        
        //Time passes with only user buying tickets 
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 61);

       //minimum participation is met therefore winner can be drawn
        winnablesTicketManager.drawWinner(0);

    }
```

### Mitigation

Consider preventing a raffle from being created with **minTickets** being equal to **maxHoldings**. Or track unique participants in a raffle and in **_checkShouldDraw()**, revert and refund if there is only 1 unique participant.
