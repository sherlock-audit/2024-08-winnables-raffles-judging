# [Mid] User can rig the draw by using multiple accounts

### Summary

A participant of a raffle can rig the draw by using multiple different accounts to buy tickets using `buyTickets` in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol`, bypassing the `maxHoldings` parameter and increasing his chances of winning a raffle.

### Root Cause

Using `maxHoldings` for the max number of tickets one user can purchase can easily be circumvented by using multiple accounts 

### Internal pre-conditions

A raffle must be created by an admin using `createRaffle` in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` and it must not be cancelled before it ends.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path
