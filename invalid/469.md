# `_checkRaffleTimings()` doesn't work properly in createRaffle()

## Summary
`_checkRaffleTimings()` doesn't work properly in createRaffle()

## Vulnerability Detail
_checkRaffleTimings() is used in createRaffle() to check if start & end time of raffle is correct or not. If start time is less than block.timestamp then start time is set to block.timestamp
```solidity
  function createRaffle(
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint64 startsAt,
        uint64 endsAt,
        uint32 minTickets,
        uint32 maxTickets,
        uint32 maxHoldings
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
->      _checkRaffleTimings(startsAt, endsAt);
...
->        raffle.startsAt = startsAt;
...
    }
```
```solidity
   function _checkRaffleTimings(uint64 startsAt, uint64 endsAt) internal view {
->      if (startsAt < block.timestamp) startsAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
        if (startsAt + MIN_RAFFLE_DURATION > endsAt) revert RaffleClosingTooSoon();
    }
```
The issue is, startAt = block.timestamp is set in _checkRaffleTimings() which has no effect on createRaffle(). As result it will not prevent admin from creating raffle in past, for which it was meant to.

## Impact
_checkRaffleTimings() doesn't work properly as it can't stop admin from creating raffle in past

VS code

## Recommendation
Return the start time from _checkRaffleTimings() & use it raffle.startAt
