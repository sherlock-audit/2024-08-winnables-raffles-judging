# Unchecked Zero Address Assignment in Role Management

## Summary
The `Roles` contract and its derivatives (`WinnablesPrizeManager`, `WinnablesTicketManager`, `WinnablesTicket`) do not validate that the address assigned a role is not the zero address (`address(0)`). This can lead to unintended role assignments and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructors of the `Roles` contract and its derivatives, the `_setRole` function is called to assign the deployer (`msg.sender`) the admin role (role 0). However, there is no check to ensure that `msg.sender` is not the zero address. If `msg.sender` is the zero address, the role assignment will still proceed, leading to the zero address having admin privileges. This can occur due to a misconfiguration or malicious intent.
`_addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));`

## Impact
The zero address having admin privileges can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check to the `_setRole` function to ensure that the address assigned the role is not a null address.
```solidity
function _setRole(address user, uint8 role, bool status) internal virtual {
    require(user != address(0), "Roles: address zero is not a valid user");
    uint256 roles = uint256(_addressRoles[user]);
    if (status) {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles | (1 << role));
    } else {
        _addressRoles[user] = bytes32(roles & ~(1 << role));
    }
    emit RoleUpdated(user, role, status);
}
```
