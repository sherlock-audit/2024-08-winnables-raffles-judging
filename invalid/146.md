# Block number is not effective in validating expiration times

### Summary

Block number is not an effective param to use when dealing with validation of expiration time because of how they can be manipulated

### Root Cause

Block number is used in validating the expiry of a signature in [`WinnablesTicketManager::_checkPurchaseSig`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L449)

### Internal pre-conditions

use block number in validation

### External pre-conditions

Miners need to manipulate block.number

### Attack Path

Manipulation of block.number by miners

### Impact

Block number can be manipulated which can lead to alot of complications like unwanted reverts

### PoC

```solidity
    function _checkPurchaseSig(uint256 raffleId, uint16 ticketCount, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata signature) internal view {
        if (blockNumber < block.number) revert ExpiredCoupon();
        //@audit block number is not effective
        address signer = _getSigner(
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked(
                    msg.sender, _userNonces[msg.sender], raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, msg.value
                )
            ), signature
        );
        if (!_hasRole(signer, 1)) revert Unauthorized();
    }
```

block number as we can see is used to validate expiry

### Mitigation

use block.timestamp instead
