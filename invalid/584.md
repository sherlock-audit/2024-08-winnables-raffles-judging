# WinnablesTicketManager.col#buyTickets - Tickets buy logis is susceptible to signature replay attacks in the case of a hard fork

## Summary
Tickets buy logis is susceptible to signature replay attacks in the case of a hard fork
## Vulnerability Detail
When users buy tickets, they send `msg.value` to the `buyTickets` function. The function has `signature` param that is used to ensure the user is allowed to buy the tickets with the price he sends. 

The problem arises if a hard fork occurs on the Avalanche because there is a possibility for a signature replay attack. A signature replay attack on the forked chain means that any signed permit given to an address on one of the chains can be re-used on the other.

So, once a user has a permit to call `buyTickets`, he can use his permit on the new forked chain and buy tickets with an already used permit.

## Impact
Possibility for a signature replay attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cache the `chainId` on contract creation and check if the current chainId equals the cashed one inside `buyTickets`.
