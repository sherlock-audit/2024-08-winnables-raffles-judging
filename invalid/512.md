# Incorrect Balance Check in withdrawTokens Function Prevents Token Withdrawal

### Summary

The withdrawTokens function fails to properly validate the token balance before attempting to withdraw tokens, which can prevent the successful withdrawal of tokens from the contract.

### Root Cause

The condition used to check if the withdrawal amount is greater than the contractâ€™s token balance is incorrect. Specifically, the check _if (amount < balance)_ is used, which is flawed because it allows the function to proceed only if the amount to withdraw is more than the contract's token balance. This means that the function will revert with _InsufficientBalance()_ if the withdrawal amount is less to the balance, what should correct.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract holds a balance of ERC20 tokens.
2. The _withdrawTokens_ function is called

### External pre-conditions

1. The tokenAddress must be a valid ERC20 token contract.
2. The token contract must be deployed and have a balance of tokens within the _WinnablesTicketManager_ contract.

### Attack Path

1. An admin attempts to withdraw tokens by calling _withdrawTokens_ with an amount that is less than the token balance.
2. The function performs an incorrect balance check and reverts the transaction, preventing any token withdrawal.

### Impact

Due to the incorrect balance check, the withdrawTokens function will not allow any tokens to be withdrawn if the amount specified is less than the balance. This prevents the contract from recovering any tokens accidentally sent to it, which could lead to loss of funds and operational issues if tokens need to be reclaimed or reallocated.
