# Unclaimed ETH raffles can be stolen by Re-entrancy

## Summary
`claimPrize` function can doesnot follow CEI pattern which leads to a reentracny attack . 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
  function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
          //...code 
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
 @>          _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender); //@audit unsafe low level call
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    }
```
`claimPrize function doesnot have a reentrancy guard and handles ETH txns. Also whether msg.sender is winner or not is checked after low level call . Which leads to this vulnerability : 

Suppose Alice won a ETH raffle and there are 5 more ETH raffle prizes to be claimed by other winners . 
1. Alice calls `claimPrize` with an unclaimed `raffleID ` 
2. logic Flow pulls the raffle and sends the prize to the caller .  There is no checks for checkiing if  caller is valid winner . 
3. From ALice's attack contract's `receive() ` function , Alice  succesfully reenters the `claimPrize`  function  as there is no reentrancy guard . And repeats from step 1 five times until all of the funds are drained . 
4. At last alice calls with his winning raffleID and succesfully concludes the `claimPrize `function  . 5 raffle prizes will be stolen . 


  ## Impact
All unclaimed ETH raffles can be stolen

Follow CEI pattern or implement a reentrancy guard !
