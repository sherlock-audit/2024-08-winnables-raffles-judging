# Not returning the ccip `messageId` might result in messaging DoS

## Summary
The lack of returning the `messageId` in all the functions that are calling `_sendCCIPMessage` causes issues in finding and manually executing failed CCIP messages on CCIP Explorer, potentially resulting in a denial of service (DoS) as subsequent transactions are withheld

## Vulnerability Detail
[According to the chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/concepts/manual-execution#overview) a CCIP message can be eligible for manual execution for various reasons:
> a CCIP message becomes eligible for manual execution for various reasons. Manual execution means that a user has to manually trigger the execution of the destination transaction after the issue that caused manual execution has been resolved
> - The receiver contract on the destination blockchain reverted due to an unhandled exception such as a logical error.
> - The receiver contract on the destination blockchain reverted due to the gas limit being insufficient to execute the triggered function (Note: The gas limit value is set in the extraArgs param of the message).
> - **The message could not be executed on the destination chain within CCIPâ€™s Smart Execution time window, which is currently set to 8 hours. This could happen, for example, during extreme network congestion and resulting gas spikes.**

[According to the docs](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/concepts/manual-execution#frequently-asked-questions), in such scenarios, all transactions after this one will be withheld until the failed transaction is executed:
> 1. **If a user sends multiple messages and the first message isn't successfully delivered and goes into a manual execution mode, does that mean all subsequent messages from the user will also be stuck?**
> It depends. If a message goes into manual execution mode due to receiver errors (unhandled exceptions or gas limit issues), subsequent messages don't get automatically blocked, unless they would encounter the same error. However, suppose a message goes into manual execution mode after the Smart Execution time window expires (currently 8 hours). In that case, subsequent messages must wait for the first message to be processed to maintain the default sequence.

When a transaction needs to be executed manually, the user should do this using [CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/). If the protocol needs to manually execute the transaction on CCIP Explorer, they should search for the transaction using one of the following items:

- Message ID
- Transaction Hash
- Address

Protocol admins or other protocols integrating with this protocol should be aware of the Message ID so they can manually execute it on CCIP Explorer.

If they cannot find and manually execute the transaction, the messaging system may experience a denial of service (DoS) because all subsequent transactions will be withheld until the failed message is executed.

In this protocol the `_sendCCIPMessage` [is responsible for sending ccip messages](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPSender.sol#L46) and it returns the `messageId` returned by the chainlink's router:
```solidity
    function _sendCCIPMessage(
        address ccipDestAddress,
        uint64 ccipDestChainSelector,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal returns(bytes32 messageId) {
        if (ccipDestAddress == address(0) || ccipDestChainSelector == uint64(0)) {
            revert MissingCCIPParams();
        }

        // Send CCIP message to the desitnation contract
        IRouterClient router = IRouterClient(CCIP_ROUTER);
        LinkTokenInterface linkToken = LinkTokenInterface(LINK_TOKEN);

        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
            receiver: abi.encode(ccipDestAddress),
            data: data,
            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
            extraArgs: "",
            feeToken: LINK_TOKEN
        });

        uint256 fee = router.getFee(
            ccipDestChainSelector,
            message
        );
        uint256 currentLinkBalance = linkToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (fee > currentLinkBalance) {
            revert InsufficientLinkBalance(currentLinkBalance, fee);
        }

@>      messageId = router.ccipSend(
            ccipDestChainSelector,
            message
        );
    }
```

Given that the `messageId` is the most unique identifier for a message and `_sendCCIPMessage` returns this `messageId`, the issue arises because all functions calling `_sendCCIPMessage`  do not return the `messageId` provided by the `_sendCCIPMessage`:
E.g:
- [lockETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L186)
- [lockTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L211)
- [lockNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L163)
- [cancelRaffle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L282)
- [propagateRaffleWinner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L340)
- etc

In the event that a CCIP message in any of the above functionalities fails and requires manual execution on the CCIP explorer, the user will have problem finding the message in the CCIP explorer
## Impact
Protocol may be DoSed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Return the `messageId` in all the functions that are calling `_sendCCIPMessage`
E.g:
```diff
    function lockETH(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint256 amount
-   ) external payable onlyRole(0) {
+   ) external payable onlyRole(0) returns(bytes32 messageId) {  
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;

        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
        _ethLocked += amount;
        _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount;

-       _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
+       messageId = _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```
