# WinnablesPrizeManager:Winner of any nft id of ETH type can stole all the contract funds due to lack of reentrancy protection

### Summary

In the claimPrize(uint256) the checks and the effects are done after the external call, which gives the attacker ability to keep reentring the contract and keep draining the funds.

### Root Cause


```sol
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked {
                _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount;
            }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked {
                _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId];
            }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED)
            revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }

     function _sendETHPrize(uint256 amount, address winner) internal {
        (bool success, ) = winner.call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) revert ETHTransferFail();
    }
```    
Here you can see when the raffle is of ETH type, raffle status is checked and updated only after the funds are sent to the winner via _sendETHPrize(uint,address), the worst part is that  there is no nonReentrant modifier applied.

That means the winner can keep making reentrant calls to claimPrize(uint) and keep stealing in denominations of his reward amount until the whole contract is drained.



### Attack Path

Imagine there are multiple ETH raffles active, which means there are lot of ETH in the winnablesPrizeManager. Suppose the contract holds 50 ethers
- Lets say raffleId with 33 has winner reward of about 2 ether;
- suppose attacker had joined this raffle via reentrancy exploit smart contract, remember he can join via mulitple contracts in order to increase his chances of attack.
- stars align sometimes! this time one of the attack contracts of the attacker became winner of the raffle
- Now he must only be able to claim 2 ethers, since that is the reward for that raffle id.
- But, the attacker exploits the reentrancy, and ends up claiming all the 50 ethers in the contract.


### Impact

All the ETH in the WinnablesPrizeManager will get stolen.

### Mitigation

Apply nonReentrant modifier on claimPrize(uint) and make sure to follow proper C.E.I pattern
