# Use of `transferFrom` in `_sendNFTPrize` can lead to NFT prizes being permanently stuck

### Summary

The use of `transferFrom` when withdrawing NFTs from the contract could cause the NFT to be stuck permanently if the recipient is a smart contract and does not properly handle incoming ERC721 tokens. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L301

Use of `transferFrom`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Participant needs to be a smart contract
2. Enter a raffle for NFT prize
3. Win raffle

### External pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. User calls `claimPrize`
2. NFT is transferred to the smart contract
3. Contract does not handle incoming ERC721 tokens properly and is permanently stuck

### Impact

NFTs can be permanently stuck in a smart contract and the raffle would be a waste

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `WinnablesTicket` contract has a check to make sure the receiver is a contract that it is valid to receive ERC1155 tokens when buying tickets for a raffle. I recommend doing the same for ERC721 using `onERC721Received` and only allowing contracts setup to receive ERC721 tokens properly to enter NFT raffles.
