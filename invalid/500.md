# Attacker can prevent admin to withdraw available tokens from the contract due to wrong balance check

## Summary
In the Winnables system, admin normally can withdraw the contract's token balance using  `withdrawTokens()` function but this is not the case in current implementation due to wrong balance check in if statement.
## Vulnerability Detail
The available balance check use wrong operator in if statement. `withdrawTokens()` function is implemented as follows:

```solidity
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
 &>     if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
In current implementation, if amount is lower than balance it reverts. So, if admin doesn't try to withdraw all the token balance it will revert. Problem arise exactly here, a potential attacker can easily prevent admin to withdraw his balance just sending 1 wei of token with frontrunning. 

## Proof of Concept

### Scenario
- Contract USDC balance is 100e6 (including decimal)
- Admin calls withdrawTokens() function with 100e6 ( if statement won't work current situtation because amout = balance )
- Attacker see that transaction and he sends 1 wei with high gas for frontrunning. 
- Now while execution of admin's call, balance will be 100e6 + 1 and amount will be 100e6, which means amount < balance
- Result: Withdraw function is reverted


## Impact
Loss of funds ( DoS)

Changing '<' operator to '>' will solve the problem
