# Users using account abstraction will not be able to claim prizes

## Summary

Users with account abstraction wallets have a different address across different chains for same account, so if someone using an account abstraction wallet wins raffle on Avalanche chain, he will not be able to claim the prize on Ethereum chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the winner is drawn in `WinnablesTicketManager` (Avalanche chain). The winning address is propagated using Chainlink CCIP.

```javascript
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
    raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
    address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

    _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
    IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
    unchecked {
        _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
    }
}
```

`_sendCCIPMessage` uses `winner` address which is taken from `_getWinnerByRequestId`. `_getWinnerByRequestId` draws a winning address from addresses that bought tickets. The issue is that winner's address on Avalanche Chain might be different from address on Ethereum Chain, if he uses Account Abstraction.

Protocol expects users to use contracts in raffle because it implements `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` in `WinnablesTicket` contract. `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` validates, if the caller is a contract. If yes, it calls `onERC1155Received` to check if contract implements necessary functionality.

```javascript
/// @dev If the recipient of a ticket is a contract, check that it is a valid receiver
  function _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
  ) private {
    if (to.isContract()) {
      try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, "") returns (bytes4 response) {
        if (response != IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {
          revert TransferRejected();
        }
      } catch {
        revert TransferRejected();
      }
    }
  }
```

When user wins the raffle, his address from Avalanche chain will be sent with CCIP to Ethereum chain.

```javascript
function _ccipReceive(
    Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
) internal override {
    (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
    bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
    if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();

    CCIPMessageType messageType = CCIPMessageType(uint8(message.data[0]));
    uint256 raffleId;
    address winner;
    if (messageType == CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED) {
        raffleId = _decodeRaffleCanceledMessage(message.data);
        _cancelRaffle(raffleId);
        return;
    }
    (raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
    _rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
    emit WinnerPropagated(raffleId, winner);
}
```

`_rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;`

Decoded winner address is set as a raffle winner. User will not be able to claim his prize as he is not in possesion of the winner address on Ethereum Chain.

## Impact

User will not be able to claim his prize after winning a raffle if he uses account abstraction.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation

Create a new parameter in `buyTickets` function and allow user to pass his Ethereum address as a prize receiver on that chain.
