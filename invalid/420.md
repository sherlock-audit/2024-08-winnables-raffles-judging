# Using `ERC721.transferFrom()` Instead of `safeTransferFrom()` May Result in NFTs Being Sent to Incompatible Contracts

## Summary
The smart contract uses `ERC721.transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` when transferring NFTs. This approach lacks the built-in safety checks that `safeTransferFrom()` offers. Specifically, `safeTransferFrom()` ensures that if the recipient is a contract, it implements the `ERC721Receiver` interface, preventing NFTs from being sent to contracts that do not handle them correctly. Using `transferFrom()` can lead to situations where NFTs are lost or become irretrievable because they are sent to incompatible addresses.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs because `transferFrom()` does not verify if the recipient is a smart contract capable of receiving and handling ERC721 tokens. While `safeTransferFrom()` includes an additional check to ensure that the receiving contract implements the `onERC721Received` function, `transferFrom()` does not. This oversight can result in NFTs being sent to contracts that do not support the ERC721 standard, potentially freezing or losing the tokens.

The affected code is found in two locations:

- The `_sendNFTPrize()` internal function uses `IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);`.
- The `withdrawNFT()` admin function uses `IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);`.

In the `_sendNFTPrize()` if the `winner` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

In the `withdrawNFT()` if the `msg.sender` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact
If the recipient of an NFT is a contract that does not correctly handle ERC721 tokens, the NFT could be permanently locked in that contract. Users or administrators would lose access to the NFT, resulting in financial loss or the inability to claim prizes.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
    IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);  // Vulnerable: should use safeTransferFrom
}

function withdrawNFT(address nft, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(0) {
    if (_nftLocked[nft][tokenId]) revert NFTLocked();
    IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);  // Vulnerable: should use safeTransferFrom
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the use of `transferFrom()` with `safeTransferFrom()` in both the `_sendNFTPrize` and `withdrawNFT` functions. This ensures that NFTs can only be sent to addresses that are either externally owned accounts (EOAs) or contracts that correctly implement the `onERC721Received` function. By implementing this change, the risk of NFTs being lost in incompatible contracts is mitigated.
