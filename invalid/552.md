# Reentrancy Attack while calling `claimPrize()`

## Summary
Reentrancy Attack while calling `claimPrize()`

## Vulnerability Detail
- Malicious user can claim all locked ETH of user's through `claimPrize()`
- As no CEI effect is followed during `claimPrize()` and state gets updated after the ETH gets transferred which leads to malicious user can do reentrancy attack and steal user's fund.
```solidity
unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
```
- So a malicious user can claim all of the Locked Eth inside the contract.


## Impact
- malicious user would steal all of the Locked Eth inside the contract.
