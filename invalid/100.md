# Winnables admins can prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize

### Summary

Missing time lock in `WinnablesPrizeManager#setCCIPCounterpart` to delay the admins from setting CCIP Counterpart will allow Winnables admins to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize as the admins will disable CCIP Counterpart in before receiving CCIP message.

### Root Cause

Missing time lock in `WinnablesPrizeManager#setCCIPCounterpart` to delay the admins from setting CCIP Counterpart

### Attack Path

From the contest's `README.md`, the protocol listed the invariants

> ### Please discuss any design choices you made.
> The principles that must always remain true are:
> - Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize
> - Participants in a raffle that got cancelled can always get refunded
> - Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle

The first invariant can be broken by the following steps:
1. Chainlink VRF Coordinator return the VRF random number to `WinnablesTicketManager`
2. `WinnablesTicketManager#propagateRaffleWinner` is called to send a CCIP message to `WinnablesPrizeManager` to set the winner
3. Before the CCIP message is sent to `WinnablesPrizeManager`, the admin will disable receiving message from `WinnablesTicketManager` by calling `WinnablesPrizeManager#setCCIPCounterpart` with `contractAddress` is the `WinnablesTicketManager`'s address and `enabled = false`.

As a result `WinnablesPrizeManager` can not receive the CCIP message that sets the winner, because `WinnablesPrizeManager#_ccipReceive` will revert at `L265`

### Impact

Winnables admins can prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize.
