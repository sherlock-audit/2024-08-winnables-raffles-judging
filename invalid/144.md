# Use `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` for `ERC721` token may cause unintended behavior for the recipient

### Summary

Use `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` for `ERC721` token may cause unintended behavior for the recipient, such as token loss if the recipient cant handle `ERC721` token or if recipient have logic on `onERC721Received()` function which can only be called using the `safeTransferFrom` function

### Root Cause

The choice to use `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` for `ERC721` token may cause unintended behavior for the recipient

### Internal pre-conditions

For `withdrawNFT()` 

1. Admin need to call `withdrawNFT()` to withdraw any NFT from the contract that is not locked in a raffle

For `_sendNFTPrize()`

1. NFT winner need to call `claimPrize()` for claiming the NFT prize

### External pre-conditions

The recipient is a smart contract that cannot handle the `ERC721` sent or a smart contract that has logic in the `onERC721Received()` function that should be called

### Attack Path

For `withdrawNFT()` 

1. Admin call `withdrawNFT()` to withdraw any NFT from the contract that is not locked in a raffle

For `_sendNFTPrize()`

1. NFT winner call `claimPrize()` for claiming the NFT prize

### Impact

This issue can lead to unintended behavior for the recipient, such as token loss if the recipient cant handle `ERC721` token or if recipient have logic on `onERC721Received()` function which can only be called using the `safeTransferFrom` function

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `safeTransferFrom()` function for ERC721 token
