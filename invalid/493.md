# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` Function Due to Incorrect Operation Order (CEI not followed)

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in the smart contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the incorrect order of operations. This vulnerability allows an attacker to claim a prize multiple times, potentially draining the contract of its ETH balance. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the current order of operations in the `claimPrize` function:

1. The function first processes the prize distribution (sending ETH, transferring tokens, or unlocking NFTs).
2. Only after sending the prize does it check if the caller is the legitimate winner.
3. Finally, it checks if the prize has already been claimed and updates the status.

This order violates the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern, creating a window for reentrancy, particularly for ETH prizes. An attacker can exploit this by:

1. Creating a malicious contract that calls claimPrize.
2. In the receive function of this malicious contract, calling claimPrize again before the first transaction completes.
3. Repeating this process multiple times, claiming the prize several times before the status is updated to "CLAIMED".

**Detailed Reentrancy Attack Vector:**

**Setup**
1. The vulnerable contract is WinnablesPrizeManager.sol, which contains the `claimPrize` function with the following order of operations:
- Send prize
- Check if caller is winner
- Check if prize is already claimed
- Mark prize as claimed
2. Let's suppose an  ETH raffle exists within the Winnables platform with a prize of 1 ETH.
3. The attacker deploys a malicious contract (let's call it `AttackerContract`) designed to exploit the vulnerability in WinnablesPrizeManager.

**Attack Preparation**
The `AttackerContract` includes an `executePrizeClaimAttack` function that calls the `WinnablesPrizeManager.claimPrize` function, and a receive function designed to re-enter the claimPrize function.

**Attack Execution**
1. The attacker calls `AttackerContract.executePrizeClaimAttack()`, which in turn calls `WinnablesPrizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId)`.
2. `WinnablesPrizeManager.claimPrize` begins execution:
- It determines the prize type is ETH.
- It updates the ethLocked state variable (reducing it by the prize amount).
- It calls `_sendETHPrize` to transfer 1 ETH to the AttackerContract.
3. The ETH transfer triggers the receive function in AttackerContract.
4. Inside the receive function, before the first claimPrize call has completed, `AttackerContract` immediately calls `WinnablesPrizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId)` again.
5. This second call to `claimPrize` begins execution:
- It again determines the prize type is ETH.
- It again updates the ethLocked state variable.
- It again calls _sendETHPrize to transfer 1 ETH to the AttackerContract.
6. This process repeats, creating a recursive loop of claimPrize calls, each transferring 1 ETH to the AttackerContract.
7. The loop continues until completely draining the contract
8. Once the recursive calls complete, the original `claimPrize` execution continues:
- It checks if the caller (AttackerContract) is eligible for the prize - this check passes due to the vulnerability.
- It checks if the prize is already claimed - this check passes as it hasn't been marked claimed yet.
- It marks the prize as claimed.

The attack is complete. The `AttackerContract` has now received multiple payouts of the 1 ETH prize from the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant:

1. Financial Loss: The contract could be drained of all its ETH, leading to substantial financial losses for the protocol and its users.
2. Fairness Violation: It undermines the fairness of the raffle system, allowing a single winner to claim multiple prizes.
3. Trust Erosion: Once exploited, this vulnerability would severely damage user trust in the platform.
4. Potential System Halt: If the contract relies on maintaining an ETH balance for operations, this attack could effectively halt the entire system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern:

1. First, check if the caller is the winner and if the prize hasn't been claimed yet.
2. Then, update the prize status to CLAIMED.
3. Finally, send the prize.

Additionally, consider implementing a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard contract as an extra layer of protection.
