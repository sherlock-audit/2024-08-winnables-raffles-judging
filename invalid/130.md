# WinnablesPrizeManager.sol -The contract does not have `onERC721Received` function so any NFT transfers will fail

## Summary
The contract does not have `onERC721Received` function so any NFT transfers will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
NFTs can be used for rewards in WinnablesPrizeManager.sol. However, the contract does not include a receive function for NFTs. While the contract assumes NFTs will be received and used as rewards, there is no functionality to properly handle such transfers and any attempt to transfer NFTs to the contract will likely fail, preventing the contract from acquiring the intended reward assets.

## Impact
The contract can't receive NFTs.
