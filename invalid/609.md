# Incompatibility with smart accounts will cause prizes to be stuck for raffle winners

### Summary

Incompatibility with smart accounts such as multi-sig or account abstraction wallets will cause prizes to be stuck for raffle winners as they won't be able to claim them due to having different addresses on Ethereum Mainnet and Avalanche.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability lies in the address validation check at [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L120). This condition ensures that the winner and the claimant addresses are identical, which is not the case for multisig/AA wallets operating across different chains such as Ethereum and Avalanche.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Winner of the raffle must have a multisig/AA wallet

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

As a result, the winner is not able to claim their prize via `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` on Ethereum mainnet and the funds remain stuck forever.

### PoC

Proof of Concept:

1. Admin locks the prize into `WinnablesPrizeManager` for a given raffle.
2. Admin creates a raffle using `WinnablesTicketManager::createRaffle` with appropriate config.
3. Users `buyTickets` for the raffle.
4. After the `minTicketsThreshold` is reached and raffle `endTime` has passed, `drawWinner` is called and propogated to mainnet.
5. The winner is a smart contract account
6. Winner tries to `claimPrize` but the transaction reverts as their Ethereum account address is different from Avalanche.
7. Funds are now stuck!

### Mitigation

1. **Implement Whitelisting**: Implement a whitelisting mechanism for known multisig/AA wallet addresses across chains to bypass the restrictive check.
2. **User Validation**: Introduce a more sophisticated user validation process that allows for different addresses on different chains but ensures the integrity of the cross-chain transfer.
