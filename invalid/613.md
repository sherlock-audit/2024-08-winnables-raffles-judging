# Admin Can Exploit Raffle System to Steal Funds and Block Prize Claims

### Summary

The admin can exploit the `WinnablesPrizeManager::setCCIPCounterpart` function to set their own contract address and ChainID:
```solidity
    function setCCIPCounterpart(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector, bool enabled) external onlyRole(0) {
        _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }
```

This function allows the admin to configure a custom address for the CCIP counterpart, which is crucial for handling Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) messages between the `WinnablesPrizeManager` and `WinnablesTicketManager` contracts. The `_ccipReceive` function includes a check to ensure that only authorized contracts listed in `_ccipContracts` can send CCIP messages:
```solidity
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
```

By setting a contract address that the admin controls, they can send arbitrary data, such as a `CANCEL` message, to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. This could allow the admin to unlock funds that should only be unlocked when a valid message from the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract is received.

Additionally, the admin can remove the current entries in the `BaseCCIPContract::_ccipContracts` variable, preventing any requests from the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract from being received by the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. As a result, users will be unable to claim their prizes after winning a raffle.

### Root Cause

The `setCCIPCounterpart` function in both the `WinnablesPrizeManager` and `WinnablesTicketManager` contracts grants the admin unrestricted control over the CCIP counterpart and chain ID settings. This function also allows the admin to remove existing values that are essential for enabling CCIP messaging between the two contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

The admin uses the `setCCIPCounterpart` function to designate a `contractAddress` that they control.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

First Attack Scenario:
1. The admin calls `WinnablesPrizeManager::setCCIPCounterpart` to set a custom CCIP counterpart and chain ID that they control.
2. The admin then calls `WinnablesPrizeManager::_ccipReceive` to send a message canceling the raffle.
3. Upon cancellation, the admin withdraws the locked prize funds.
4. The admin subsequently calls `WinnablesTicketManager::drawWinner` to generate a random number and draw a winner.
5. After the winner is drawn, the admin calls `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner` to trigger the withdrawal of ticket funds via the `withdrawETH` function.

Second Attack Scenario:
1. The admin removes the legitimate `BaseCCIPContract::_ccipContracts` entry, ensuring that the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract does not receive any incoming messages from the `WinnablesTicketManager` contract.
2. As a result, users are unable to claim their prizes because the necessary CCIP message is never received.

### Impact

Users suffer losses as they are unable to claim the raffle prize they won.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Resolving this issue on-chain is challenging, but the protocol can mitigate the risk by modifying the `setCCIPCounterpart` function. By requiring the admin to provide a signature generated via an external API, similar to the approach used in the `buyTickets` function, this vulnerability can be fixed. This change would ensure that only authorized signatures can modify CCIP counterpart and chain ID settings, thereby preventing unauthorized changes.
