# When `lockETH` is called the amount can differ from the actual ETH send

## Summary

The `lockETH` function in `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract allows the admin to lock a specified amount of ETH as a prize for a raffle. However, the function does not valiadte that the amount of ETH sent with the transaction matches the `amount` parameter specified in the function call.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `amount` parameter that represents the amount of ETH intended to be locked as a prize may not equal the actual sended amount. As a result, the function allows transactions where the amount of ETH sent may differ from the amount specified. 

For example if the `amount` parameter is less than the actual `msg.value`, `_ethLocked` will differ from the actual balance of the contract, allowing the admin to withdraw the difference through `withdrawETH` function.
## Impact

Unintended access to contract funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the `msg.value` equals the `amount` specified:
```diff
    /// @notice (Admin) Send the prize for a Raffle to its rightful winner
    /// @param ticketManager Address of the Ticket Manager on the remote chain
    /// @param chainSelector CCIP Chain selector of the remote chain
    /// @param raffleId ID of the Raffle that will be associated
    /// @param amount Amount of ETH to lock as a prize
    function lockETH(
        address ticketManager,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        uint256 raffleId,
        uint256 amount
    ) external payable onlyRole(0) {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _checkValidRaffle(raffleId);
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
+       require(msg.value == amount, "Not equal");
        if (ethBalance < amount + _ethLocked) revert InvalidPrize();
        rafflePrize.raffleType = RaffleType.ETH;
        _ethLocked += amount;
        _ethRaffles[raffleId] = amount;

        _sendCCIPMessage(ticketManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(raffleId));
        emit ETHPrizeLocked(raffleId, amount);
    }
```
