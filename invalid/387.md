# WinnablesTicket::transferOwnership lack of two-step process for ownership changes

### Summary

 WinnablesTicket::transferOwnership lack of two-step process for ownership changes

### Root Cause

In WinnablesTicket::transferOwnership:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L173-L176
```solidity
  /// @notice (Owner) Transfer contract ownership (only for Marketplace admin rights)
  /// @param newOwner Address of the new owner account
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    owner = newOwner;
    emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, newOwner);
  }
```

The account with owner role can call transferOwnership to transfer owner role to a new owner account, however there is no validity check on the new owner address.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Only accounts that have become owner roles can call the transferOwnership function

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The old owner role invoke the transferOwnership() function on the WinnablesTicket contract to change the address of WinnablesTicket contract's owner.
2. The old owner accidentally enter the wrong address, and ownership of the contract is transferred to the incorrect address. 

### Impact

The owner role of the WinnablesTicket contract may be set to an invalid address and cannot be revoked, which will cause the onlyOwner related functions of the contract to fail.

### Mitigation

Implement zero address check and consider implementing a two step process where the owner nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an acceptOwnership() function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.
