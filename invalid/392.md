# An attacker can steal gas from other callers

### Summary

When the project party uses the `refundPlayers` function to perform a refund for the user, there is no gas limit for sending ETH. The user may use this call to implement complex operations, thus stealing the gas paid by the project party.

### Root Cause

In the [contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L484), there is no fixed gas limit used for transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

The project side needs to call the `refundPlayers` function to refund users.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Users can implement complex logic in the receive function, so that when the project party refunds it, it will be called using the gas paid by the project party.

### Impact

The project party may pay more gas for the attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a fixed gas limit when calling.
