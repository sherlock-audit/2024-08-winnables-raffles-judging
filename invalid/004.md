# Use of transferFrom Instead of safeTransferFrom Risks NFT Loss in ERC721 Transfers

## Summary
The contract uses transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom when transferring NFTs, which can lead to potential loss of tokens if the recipient is a contract that doesn't support ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdrawNFT function and potentially other places in the contract, transferFrom is used to transfer NFTs:
```solidity
function withdrawNFT(address nft, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(0) {
    if (_nftLocked[nft][tokenId]) revert NFTLocked();
    IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```
The transferFrom function doesn't check if the recipient can handle ERC721 tokens. If the recipient is a contract that doesn't implement onERC721Received, the transfer will succeed, but the recipient contract won't be able to interact with the NFT, effectively locking it.
## Impact
Using transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom can potentially lead to NFTs being locked in contracts that don't support ERC721 tokens. This could result in permanent loss of valuable assets.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
```

## Recommendation
Replace all instances of transferFrom with safeTransferFrom when transferring NFTs. This applies to the withdrawNFT function and any other places in the contract where NFTs are transferred. For example:
```solidity
function withdrawNFT(address nft, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(0) {
    if (_nftLocked[nft][tokenId]) revert NFTLocked();
    IERC721(nft).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```
