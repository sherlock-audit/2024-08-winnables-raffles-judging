# Reentrancy in `claimPrize` still exists in the code under audit

## Summary

The code under audit contains function [WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124), which allows to claim prizes multiple times via a trivial reentrancy attack: the code doesn't adhere to the checks-effects-interactions pattern, so upon sending the funds e.g. via [_sendETHPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L314-L316) the receiving function can reenter `claimPrize` and claim the prize repeatedly.

The issue has been raised already in the [Peckshield audit](https://github.com/Winnables/public-contracts/blob/main/audits/2024-08-05-Peckshield-Audit-Report.pdf), and fixed in [commit dd62e8a](https://github.com/Winnables/public-contracts/commit/dd62e8a), but for some reason the fix has not propagated to the code being audited in this contest, so I feel obliged to report the issue.

It should be noted also that the same root cause (reentrancy in `claimPrize`) opens the doors for other exploits: e.g. by claiming the ETH prize twice, the locked ETH balance tracked via `_ethLocked` variable will be off, and will lead to bricking the protocol (e.g. [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L181) will revert).
