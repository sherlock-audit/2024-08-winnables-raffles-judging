# Admin can steal funds from ticket sales, and rug raffle participants

## Summary

As per contest's README: "The protocol working as expected relies on having an admin creating raffles. It should be expected that the admin will do their job. However it is not expected that the admin can steal funds that should have ended in a raffle participantâ€™s wallet in any conceivable way." 

Essentially admins are trusted roles, but in this context if an admin can steal funds from ticket sales, it will be evaluated as a valid issue. This is also confirmed by the sponsor. Describing how this scenario can happen below:

## Vulnerability Detail

Will explain how the CCIP functionality is involved in the project:

1. Raflle admin locks funds on the prize manager, this sends a cross-chain message to the ticket manager contract, allowing the raffle creations there
2. Then on the ticket manager contract, when a winner is selected it sends a message back to the prize manager, with the necessary information, which allow the selected user to claim his prize

If we take a more detailed look on the codebase `2.` is happening on the `WinnablesTicketManager::propagateRaffleWinner()` function: 

```javascript
/// @notice (Public) Send a cross-chain message to the Prize Manager to
    ///         mark the prize as claimable by the winner
    /// @param raffleId ID of the Raffle we wish to draw a winner for
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

@>      _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
@>          _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

If we notice this function can be called by anyone and the prize manager address is an input parameter, that means it can be set as any address, and in case that the function call is successful it unlocks the ETH collected from ticket sales, so the admin can withdraw them.

Here is a very detailed example, clarifying the exploit:

1. Raffle admin locks funds and send a message, giving green light for raffle creations
2. Winner is selected, now the propagate winner function can be called
3. Beforehand a malicious admin has created a mock message receiver contract, which will simply allow messages to be received successfully
4. The admin calls `propagateRaffleWinner()` with the `prizeManager` parameter as the address of the mock message receiver contract
5. The message is received successfully, but since no funds will be locked on it, no winner can claim, only the information as raffle id and winner will be stored there
6. Subsequently the ETH from ticket sales will be unlocked
7. Admin rugs, as there will be no prize to claim, and steals from honest users


## Following the withdraw scenario:

   - Users buy tickets, `_lockedETH` and `raffle.totalRaised` get incremented by the `msg.value` sent, lets say total 1000e18
   - `address(this).balance` = `1000e18`
   - `_lockedETH` = `1000e18`
   - `raffle.totalRaised` = `1000e18`

```javascript
    function buyTickets(
       ...
    ) external payable {
        ...
        unchecked {
            raffle.totalRaised += msg.value;
            _userNonces[msg.sender]++;
            _lockedETH += msg.value;
        }
```

   - `propagateRaffleWinner()` is called: 

```javascript
function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        ...
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }
```

   - `_lockedETH` becomes `0`
   - admin calls `withdrawETH`:

```javascript
/// @notice (Admin) Withdraw ETH from a canceled raffle or ticket sales
    function withdrawETH() external onlyRole(0) {
        uint256 balance;
        unchecked {
            balance = address(this).balance - _lockedETH;
        }
        _sendETH(balance, msg.sender);
    }
```

   - `balance` = 1000e18 - 0 = 1000e18
   - Successfully steals funds from ticket sales, without giving a raffle prize 

## Impact

- High: as admin will still be on profit from executing the attack, even after the locked value and `LINK` subscription for Chainlink services

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To keep the code with minimal changes and assure maximum security, i would say restrict the admin from being able to call `propagateRaffleWinner()`. This way the responsibility falls on users shoulders but they will be incentivized to make the call in order to get their reward.
