# Admin can set the winner of the raffle to an address of his choosing

### Summary

In the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract, an admin has to first lock some prize via the [lockNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L148-L165), [lockETH()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L172-L188), or [lockTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L196-L213) functions, then a CCIP message will be sent to the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract, and the admin can then fully set the raffle via the [createRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L252-L274) function. Once all the contracts are deployed the admin has to set the correct **contractAddress** and **chainSelector** via the [setCCIPCounterpart()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L134-L140) function, so the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function can't be called by anyone, but only from an approved address on a specific chain. In the readme of the contest it is specifically said that the admin is not fully trusted: *Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize* & *However it is not expected that the admin can steal funds that should have ended in a raffle participantâ€™s wallet in any conceivable way*. However these core protocol invariants can be easily broken by a malicious admin. As can be seen from the code snippet below an admin can approve multiple contract on different chains to call the [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function via the [setCCIPCounterpart()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L134-L140) function:
```solidity
    function setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }
```
A malicious admin can utilize this to set up a contract which sends a message to the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function and sets a winner for a specific raffle. Thus the admin can steal the promised rewards for the actual winner of the raffle, and the winner will get absolutely nothing in return, however the admin can still withdraw the accumulated tokens from the ticket sales from the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract. The admin can also utilize a malicious contract to call the [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function, and cancel a raffle, thus freeing the funds he locked when he created the raffle. If for example he locked **1e18 ETH** as a prize for raffle 1, and approves a malicious contract to call [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278), then he uses the malicious contract to call the [WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) and cancels raffle 1, the admin can withdraw **1e18 ETH** from the contract. When a winner is drawn and set and tries to call the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function and claim his prize, he won't be able to as there won't be any ETH in the contract. 
### Root Cause

A malicious admin can approve multiple contracts to call the [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function via the [setCCIPCounterpart()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L134-L140) function .

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin creates a raffle
2. Users start buying tickets via the [buyTickets()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L182-L210) function, but a winner is not yet drawn


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Admin creates a raffle with ID 1
2. Admin approves a contract he controls to successfully send messages to the ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function
3. As users are buying tickets for raffle with ID 1, the malicious admin can utilize the contract he approved in step 2 to send a CCIP message to ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`` contract [_ccipReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278) function, which sets the address of the winner for the raffle with ID 1 to an address that the attacker controls. lets call it **address A**. 
4. Now  **address A**  can call the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function and claim the prize that the admin initially locked. 
```solidity
    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        ...
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        ...
    }
```  
As can be seen from the code snippet below the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function sets the **rafflePrize.status** to **CLAIMED**, so this function will always revert when called again. 
5. When there have been enough users, and a winner can be drawn for the raffle with ID 1, the attacker or the unsuspecting users can call the [propagateRaffleWinner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L334-L345) function, so the AVAX that was accumulated from the tickets that the users bought can be freely withdrawn by the admin via the [withdrawETH()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L300-L306). As mentioned in step 4, when the newly set winner for the raffle with ID 1, tries to call the [claimPrize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105-L124) function in order to claim his prize, the function will revert. 

### Impact

A malicious admin can set the winner of a certain raffle, and in this way deny the winner of the raffle from withdrawing his prize. Or cancel the raffle only in ``WinnablesPrizeManager.sol``, and withdraw the funds he locked when he initially created the raffle. At the same time he can also withdraw the proceeds from the sold tickets in the ``WinnablesTicketManager.sol`` contract. Thus breaking a couple of protocol invariants and effectively stealing money from the users, thus the high severity.

### Mitigation

Allow the admin to call the [setCCIPCounterpart()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L134-L140) function only once, and set the correct parameters.
