# Tokens with callbacks such as ERC777 when used as raffle prizes expose other unclaimed token prizes in the contract to theft

## Summary
For tokens with callbacks for example the ERC777 token used as raffle prizes, any winner can implement a reentrancy on their receiving contract to drain the prize manager of such token balances at the time of prize claims stealing from other unclaimed raffle balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attack steps:

1. Attacker calls `claimPrize` on Prize manager
2. Token contract executes `tokensReceived` on attacker contract
3. Attacker calls `claimPrize` again
4. Repeats the process until the prize manager contract reaches a state where it no longer has sufficient balance
5. The raffle status is then marked as `CLAIMED` and thus other unclaimed prizes are lost to the attacker

The `tokensReceived` hook of the ERC777 contract happens after the receiver gets the token and since at this time the raffle prizes' status is not yet mutated, they can reenter thus manipulating the update to happen only once at the end of the entire transaction instead of subsequently.

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
       ...
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
@>  if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed(); // @audit done too late
@>  rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED; // @audit done too late
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```

## Impact
Theft of other unclaimed raffle prizes in the prize manager contract on Ethereum during the exploit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the checks up top before the if statements:

```diff
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
+   if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
+   rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
        ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
        ...
    } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
        ...
    } else revert InvalidRaffle();
    
    if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
-    if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
-    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
    emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
}
```
