# Admin can prevent winner from withdrawing prize

### Summary

The admin can prevent the winner from claiming by changing `_ccipContracts[counterpart]`. Although this is an action taken by the admin, it violates the restrictions described in the documentation, so I consider it a valid vulnerability.

### Root Cause

The README had the following requirements written:

> The principles that must always remain true are:

After selecting the winner in `tickerManger`, a message will be sent to `priceManager` via CCIP.
```solidity
    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
``` 

In the `ccipReceive` of `prizeManager`, `if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L265
```solidity
    function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
``` 

`_ccipContracts[counterpart]` can be set by admin.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L134-L140
```solidity
    function setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) external onlyRole(0) {
        _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }
``` 

Therefore, if the admin wants to prevent a winner from withdrawing the reward, he can change the setting of `_ccipContracts[counterpart]` before `ccipReceive`, preventing the execution of `ccipReceive` and thus preventing the winner from claiming.

### Attack Path

1. `propagateRaffleWinner` selects Alice as the winner and sends a message to `priceManager` through CCIP.
2. Before `ccipReceive` is executed, the admin changes `_ccipContracts[counterpart]`, making the message that Alice is the winner unable to execute.
3. Even though Alice is marked as the winner in `tickerManager`, she is still unable to claim the reward.
4. If the admin wants to carry out a more targeted attack, they can use a sandwich attack-like approach, where they change `_ccipContracts` before Alice's `ccipReceive`, and then revert `_ccipContracts` to its original value after `ccipReceive` fails. This way, they disrupt Alice's claim without affecting subsequent functionality.

### Impact

Admin can prevent winner from withdrawing prize.
