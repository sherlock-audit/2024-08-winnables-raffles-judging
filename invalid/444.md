# Attacker can cause permanent DOS for the token withdrawal because of an incorrect check.


## Summary
There is an incorrect check in the `withdrawTokens` function an attacker can cause DOS on the token withdrawal for as long asn they want.  

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdrawTokens` function the admin can withdraw tokens that contract that are accidentally sent, There is a following check `if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance()` which is not ideal as this checks if the entered amount is less than the balance. 
The check should have been 
`if (balance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance()`. 
However even with the original check it is still possible to withdraw all the tokens if `amount == balance`. 
But whenever the admin calls this function to withdraw all tokens, an attacker can front run the transaction and send a small amount of token with minimal cost and causing this function to revert due to the above check of `amount < balance`.

## Impact
Unable to recover stuck funds

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance(); // @audit : This should be balance < amount. When amount = balance, anyone can dos with a minimum token transfer here. 
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation 
Change the condition to:
`if (balance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance()`.
