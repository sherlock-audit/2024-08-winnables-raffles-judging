# Raffle can be cancelled even if minTicketsThreshold is reached

### Summary

Because of the incorrect check in _checkShouldCancel a raffle that has reached the minTicketsThreshold will be allowed to be cancelled.

### Root Cause

In `WInnablesTicketManager.sol:440` the `if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();` check allows raffles that have reached the minTicketsThreshold also to be cancelled.
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L434-L441)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Raffle must end with supply = minTicketsThreshold.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. When a raffle ends with tickets = minTicketsThreshold,  assume a user calls the cancelRaffle function which in turn calls the _checkShouldCancel function.

2. Inside the _checkShouldCancel function all the check pass and the raffle is allowed to be cancelled.
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); // this check passes since supply = minTicketsThreshold
    }
```

Note that if the intended behavior is for the raffle to be cancelled, still the raffle can be drawn. Either way the behavior is unintended.

### Impact

This behavior of the code enables unintended results from a raffle and thus a winner is deprived of his winnings. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the check in _checkShouldCancel  as follows:
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
        if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
        if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold || supply == raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();// updated check
    }
```
