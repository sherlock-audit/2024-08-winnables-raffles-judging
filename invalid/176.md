# Excess ETH sent in buyTickets not refunded to users

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L206

In the buyTickets function the number of tickets purchased is not compared to the msg.value passed to the function. Therefore if a user calls the buyTickets function with an ETH amount and the maximum possible number of tickets is bought, the remaining unused ether is left in the contract unrefunded.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function testUserFundsNotRefunded() public {
        ///Create raffle

        
        //user buys calls buyTickets with an eth amount and hopes to mint 2 tickets
        vm.deal(alice, 10e18);
        console.log(alice.balance); //10e18
        winnablesTicketManager.buyTickets{value: 5e18}(1, 2, 0, signature);

        //user balance reduced by an amount greater than the price of 2 tickets, and gets no refund
        console.log(alice.balance); //5e18
        console.log(winnablesTicket.balanceOf(alice, 1)); //2

    }
```

## Impact
Loss of funds for the user

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement ticketCount calculation in the buyTickets function, and refund any unused ETH amounts to the function caller.
