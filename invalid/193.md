## Summary

Currently `WinnablesTicketManager` simply forward winner's `msg.sender`(on Avalanche) to `WinnablesPrizeManager`(on Ethereum), which may not controlled by the real winner.

As a result, an attacker can gain control of the winner address of an account contract that was used to deposit assets from a chain into Root, by gaining control of the same address of the account contract that deposited the assets in a different chain.

As explained in detail on this [article written by Rekt](https://rekt.news/wintermute-rekt/), it is possible to gain control of the same address for contract accounts in a different chain; especially for those contract accounts that are deployed using the Gnosis Safe contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

When winner is drawn, the winner's address(on Avalanche) will be sent directly to `WinnablesPrizeManager`(on Ethereum):

    function propagateRaffleWinner(address prizeManager, uint64 chainSelector, uint256 raffleId) external {
        Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
        if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.FULFILLED) revert InvalidRaffleStatus();
        raffle.status = RaffleStatus.PROPAGATED;
        address winner = _getWinnerByRequestId(raffle.chainlinkRequestId);

        _sendCCIPMessage(prizeManager, chainSelector, abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner));
        IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).refreshMetadata(raffleId);
        unchecked {
            _lockedETH -= raffle.totalRaised;
        }
    }

It incorrectly assumes that the address `raffle.winner` on Ethereum is owned by the same person on Avalanche chain. There are 2 cases when the assumption is not guaranteed:
