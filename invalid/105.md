# Unchecked arithmetic in mint function can lead to incorrect balance and supply values for users.

### Summary

The unchecked arithmetic in the mint function of WinnablesTicket.sol will cause incorrect balance and supply values for users as an attacker or user can mint an extremely large number of tickets, causing an overflow in the contract's state variables.

### Root Cause

There is unchecked arithmetic when updating the _balances and _supplies mappings, which can result in overflow, leading to incorrect state management.

- [Line 190](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L190) : `_balances[id][to] += amount;`
- [Line 191](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L191) : `_supplies[id] += amount;`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user must have the role required to call the mint function (role ID 1).
2. The amount passed to the mint function needs to be set to an extremely large value (2^256 - 1).

### External pre-conditions

1. The gas price needs to be high enough to allow the large transaction to be processed within a single block.
2. No other users are interacting with the contract in the same transaction window to avoid interference.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls setRole to ensure their address has the required role to mint tickets (role ID 1).
2. The attacker calls mint with an amount equal to 2^256 - 1, targeting a specific raffle ID.
3. The unchecked arithmetic in mint causes an overflow, leading to an incorrect _balances and _supplies state for that raffle ID.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from corrupted internal state management, with incorrect balances and supplies for users. The attacker may cause a situation where balances appear erroneously large or supply limits are exceeded, disrupting the integrity of the ticketing system. This could lead to potential financial loss or loss of trust in the protocol.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```javascript
describe('Overflow Test', () => {
    it('Should cause incorrect balances and supply due to overflow in mint function', async () => {
      await (await ticket.setRole(signers[0].address, 1, true)).wait();
      
      // This is the maximum possible value for uint256
      const largeAmount = BigNumber.from('0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff');
  
      // Mint a large amount of tickets to potentially cause an overflow
      await ticket.mint(signers[1].address, 1, largeAmount);
  
      // Check the resulting balance and supply
      const balance = await ticket.balanceOf(signers[1].address, 1);
      const supply = await ticket.supplyOf(1);
  
      // Since an overflow should cause incorrect state, let's check if the balance or supply is not as expected
      expect(balance).to.not.equal(largeAmount);
      expect(supply).to.not.equal(largeAmount);
    });
  });
```


### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, remove the unchecked block in the mint function and allow Solidity's built-in overflow checks to handle arithmetic operations. This will automatically revert the transaction if an overflow occurs, preventing the incorrect state from being set.

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
    require(to != address(0), "Cannot mint to the zero address");
    
    // Use checked arithmetic to prevent overflow
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    _supplies[id] += amount;
    
    _ticketOwnership[id][_supplies[id]] = to;
    emit NewTicket(id, _supplies[id], amount);
    emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(msg.sender, address(0), to, id, amount);
}
```
