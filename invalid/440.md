# Incorrect nonce handling will allow signature replay attacks, leading to unauthorized ticket purchases for participants

### Summary

- Root Cause: The `buyTickets` function increments the nonce after checking the signature.

- Impact: Unauthorized ticket purchases and financial discrepancies.

- Affected Party: Participants of the raffle.

- Actor: An attacker.

- Attack Path: The attacker will reuse the same signature within the same block, bypassing the nonce check and making multiple unauthorized ticket purchases.

### Root Cause

 In `WinnablesTicketManager.sol: _userNonces[msg.sender]++;` is incremented after `_checkPurchaseSig`, allowing the same signature to be reused within the same block. 
This oversight can lead to unauthorized ticket purchases and financial discrepancies for participants. The nonce should be incremented before checking the signature to ensure that each signature is unique and cannot be reused, preventing replay attacks.

_checkPurchaseSig(raffleId, ticketCount, blockNumber, signature);
_userNonces[msg.sender]++;

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract needs to increment `_userNonces[msg.sender]` after `_checkPurchaseSig` is called.
2. The contract needs to allow the same signature to be reused within the same block due to the nonce being incremented after the signature check.

### External pre-conditions

The issue arises from how the nonce is handled within the contract. So its due to internal contract logic. There are no specific external conditions required for the  vulnerability path to happen. 

### Attack Path


1. The attacker calls the `buyTickets` function with the following parameters:
- `raffleId`: A valid raffle ID.
- `ticketCount`: The number of tickets to purchase.
- `blockNumber`: The current block number.
- `signature`: A valid signature for the purchase.

2. The `buyTickets` function calls `_checkPurchaseSig` to verify the signature before incrementing the nonce `_userNonces[msg.sender]++;`.

3. - The attacker reuses the same signature within the same block before the nonce is incremented.
    - Since the nonce has not been incremented yet, the signature remains valid for multiple transactions within the same block.

4. - The `_checkPurchaseSig` function verifies the signature using the current nonce value.
    - Because the nonce is incremented after the signature check, the same signature can be reused, bypassing the nonce check.

5. The attacker successfully makes multiple unauthorized ticket purchases using the same signature. This leads to financial discrepancies as the attacker can purchase more tickets than intended or manipulate the ticket purchase process.

### Impact

- Affected Party: Participants of the raffle.

- Loss: Participants suffer loss of funds due to unauthorized ticket purchases and financial discrepancies, without extensive limitations of external conditions. It affects the core functionality of the raffle system.

- Attacker's Gain: The attacker gains an unfair advantage by exploiting the incorrect nonce handling, allowing them to make multiple unauthorized ticket purchases using the same signature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- the nonce should be incremented before checking the signature., this ensures that each signature is unique and cannot be reused within the same block.
