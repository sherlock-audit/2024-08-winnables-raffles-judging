# Claimed raffle can still be cancelled and Vice-Versa

## Summary
In the `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::claimPrize` and the `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol::_cancelRaffle` functions, there is no synchronization to ensure a cancelled raffle cannot be claimed and vice versa.

## Vulnerability Detail
The WInnablesPrizeManager is the holder of the prizes of all raffles, in the `_cancelRaffle` function, there is only a check for the status of the raffle is cancelled `if (_rafflePrize[raffleId].status == RafflePrizeStatus.CANCELED) revert InvalidRaffle();` so if the `_rafflePrize[raffleId].status` holds any other state aside RafflePrizeStatus.CANCELED, it'll pass.

IN the `claimPrize`, there is no check for `_rafflePrize[raffleId].status == RafflePrizeStatus.CANCELED`, meaning a winner of a pending or already cancelled raffle can still claim the prize.

## Impact

Loss of funds, as  cancel prize reduces prizes left and claim does same thing, cause accounting issues and loss of funds
