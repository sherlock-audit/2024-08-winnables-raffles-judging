# 'shouldCancelRaffle' Function Always Returns True Due to Reverts in Internal Checks

### Summary

The shouldCancelRaffle function is intended to determine if a raffle should be canceled based on specific criteria. However, the current implementation always returns true because the internal _checkShouldCancel function performs checks and reverts if conditions are not met, rather than returning a value that reflects the raffle's cancel status. This leads to potential issues in scenarios where other functions or systems expect a clear boolean response.

- _checkShouldCancel:

### Root Cause

- The _shouldCancelRaffle_ function always returns _true_ because it relies on the __checkShouldCancel_ function to perform various checks. __checkShouldCancel_ does not return a value; it either reverts with an error or completes without a return.
- This design fails to convey meaningful information when other components depend on a true or false response to determine the cancellation status.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Functions or systems expecting a boolean response for cancellation status will always receive _true_, regardless of the actual state of the raffle.
- This results in potential mismanagement of raffles and incorrect handling based on misleading or inaccurate cancellation information.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To ensure that _shouldCancelRaffle_ provides accurate and actionable information, the internal __checkShouldCancel_ should be restructured to return a boolean value indicating whether the raffle should be canceled. This will allow _shouldCancelRaffle_ to return the correct value directly based on the internal checks.
