# Lack of enforced access control in `BaseCCIPContract::_setCCIPCounterpart` enables potential unauthorized manipulation of CCIP counterparts in derived contracts, risking misdirection of cross-chain messages and potential loss of funds

### Summary

The `BaseCCIPContract.sol` contains an internal `_setCCIPCounterpart` function that lacks enforced access control. If exposed without proper restrictions in derived contracts, this could allow unauthorized modification of CCIP counterparts, potentially compromising cross-chain message integrity and risking loss of funds.

LoC below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/BaseCCIPContract.sol#L31-L38

### Root Cause

The `_setCCIPCounterpart` function in `BaseCCIPContract.sol` is designed to manage approved counterpart CCIP contracts on remote chains. While this function is internal and cannot be directly called externally, there's a risk that derived contracts might expose this functionality without implementing proper access controls.

```solidity
function _setCCIPCounterpart(
    address contractAddress,
    uint64 chainSelector,
    bool enabled
) internal {
    bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(contractAddress, chainSelector);
    _ccipContracts[counterpart] = enabled;
}
```

If a derived contract were to expose this function without restrictions, it could allow any external actor to add or remove CCIP counterparts, potentially disrupting cross-chain operations and compromising the security of cross-chain messages and transactions.

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract owner needs to call setCounterpart() to set a legitimate counterpart address to be exactly a specific address for a given chain selector.
_ccipContracts mapping needs to have at least one entry for a legitimate counterpart.
Access control for setCounterpart() function needs to be absent or misconfigured.
_setCCIPCounterpart() internal function needs to be exposed through the public setCounterpart() function.
isCounterpartEnabled() function needs to be publicly accessible for verification.

### External pre-conditions

The contract needs to be deployed on a blockchain network that supports cross-chain interactions (e.g., a network compatible with Chainlink CCIP).
The attacker needs to have sufficient gas to call the setCounterpart() function.
The network's gas price needs to be low enough for the attacker to afford multiple transactions.
The blockchain network needs to be operational and accepting transactions.
The attacker needs to have knowledge of the legitimate counterpart address and chain selector.

### Attack Path

The vulnerable contract is deployed with an exposed setCounterpart function lacking proper access control.

The contract owner sets a legitimate counterpart address for a specific chain selector.

An attacker identifies the lack of access control on the setCounterpart function.

The attacker calls setCounterpart to disable the legitimate counterpart address.

The attacker calls setCounterpart again to add their own malicious counterpart address.

The vulnerable contract now considers the attacker's address as a valid counterpart for cross-chain interactions.

This allows the attacker to potentially intercept or manipulate cross-chain messages and transactions.

The original legitimate counterpart is disabled, disrupting normal cross-chain operations.

The contract owner and users may be unaware of this change, leading to potential fund loss or other security issues.

The attacker can exploit this position to carry out further malicious actions across the connected chains.

### Impact

If exploited in a derived contract, this vulnerability could lead to:
- Misdirection of cross-chain messages: Messages could be sent to unauthorized or malicious contracts on other chains.
- Potential loss or theft of funds: If cross-chain transfers are involved, funds could be redirected to attacker-controlled addresses.
- Disruption of cross-chain operations: By adding invalid counterparts or removing valid ones, the normal flow of cross-chain communication could be severely disrupted.
- Compromise of protocol trust: Unauthorized changes to CCIP counterparts could undermine the trust in the entire cross-chain communication system.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we created a `VulnerableContract.sol` that exposes the `_setCCIPCounterpart` function without proper access control:

```solidity
contract VulnerableContract is BaseCCIPContract {
    constructor(address router) BaseCCIPContract(router) {}

    // Exposing the internal function without access control
    function setCounterpart(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector, bool enabled) external {
        _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }

    // Helper function to check if a counterpart is enabled
    function isCounterpartEnabled(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) external view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(contractAddress, chainSelector);
        return _ccipContracts[counterpart];
    }
}
```

A test file, `ExploitTest.t.sol` (in the `test` directory) was created to demonstrate the exploit:

```solidity
function testExploit() public {
    // Assume the contract owner has set a legitimate counterpart
    vm.prank(address(this));
    vulnerableContract.setCounterpart(legitimateCounterpart, chainSelector, true);
    
    // Verify the legitimate counterpart is set
    assertTrue(vulnerableContract.isCounterpartEnabled(legitimateCounterpart, chainSelector));

    // Attacker exploits the unprotected function
    vm.prank(attacker);
    vulnerableContract.setCounterpart(legitimateCounterpart, chainSelector, false);

    // Verify the attacker was able to disable the legitimate counterpart
    assertFalse(vulnerableContract.isCounterpartEnabled(legitimateCounterpart, chainSelector));

    // Attacker sets their own malicious counterpart
    address maliciousCounterpart = address(0xBAD);
    vm.prank(attacker);
    vulnerableContract.setCounterpart(maliciousCounterpart, chainSelector, true);

    // Verify the attacker was able to add their malicious counterpart
    assertTrue(vulnerableContract.isCounterpartEnabled(maliciousCounterpart, chainSelector));
}
```

The following command was run in the terminal to run the test:

```solidity
forge test --match-test testExploit -vvvv
```

The test results were as follows:

```solidity

These results show that:
- The legitimate counterpart was initially set successfully.
- An attacker (0x...BEEF) was able to disable the legitimate counterpart.
- The attacker was able to add their own malicious counterpart (0x...BAD).


### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability and ensure robust access control, we recommend implementing OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` contract. This provides a flexible, role-based access control system that has been thoroughly audited and widely adopted in the industry. 

Here's the updated `BaseCCIPContract.sol` with OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` incorporated:

```diff
+ import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

- contract BaseCCIPContract {
+ contract BaseCCIPContract is AccessControl {
    error InvalidRouter(address router);
    error UnauthorizedCCIPSender();

    address internal immutable CCIP_ROUTER;

+   bytes32 public constant CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE = keccak256("CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE");

    constructor(address router) {
        CCIP_ROUTER = router;
+       _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
+       _setupRole(CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

+   function setCCIPCounterpart(
+       address contractAddress,
+       uint64 chainSelector,
+       bool enabled
+   ) public onlyRole(CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+       _setCCIPCounterpart(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
+   }

    function _setCCIPCounterpart(
        address contractAddress,
        uint64 chainSelector,
        bool enabled
    ) internal {
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(contractAddress, chainSelector);
        _ccipContracts[counterpart] = enabled;
+       emit CCIPCounterpartSet(contractAddress, chainSelector, enabled);
    }

+   // Optional: Add a function to grant the CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE
+   function grantCCIPManagerRole(address account) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+       grantRole(CCIP_MANAGER_ROLE, account);
+   }

+   // Event to log CCIP counterpart changes
+   event CCIPCounterpartSet(address indexed contractAddress, uint64 indexed chainSelector, bool enabled);

    function _packCCIPContract(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) internal pure returns(bytes32) {
        return bytes32(
            uint256(uint160(contractAddress)) |
            uint256(chainSelector << 160)
        );
    }
}
```

This implementation provides fine-grained access control, allows for multiple managers if needed, and improves the contract's security posture while maintaining flexibility for legitimate operations.

As an additional option, consider implementing further security measures such as multi-signature functionality for high-stakes changes. For multi-signature functionality, you would typically implement this at a higher level, such as using a multi-sig wallet as the owner of the contract or as the holder of the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. The exact implementation would depend on the specific multi-sig solution chosen.
