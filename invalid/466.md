# Reentrancy Vulnerability in claimPrize Function Allows Multiple Prize Claims

## Summary
The claimPrize function in the WinnablesPrizeManager contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability allows an attacker to claim an ETH prize multiple times before the prize status is updated, potentially draining the contract of more funds than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists because the claimPrize function performs external calls (ETH transfers) before updating the prize status to CLAIMED. This order of operations violates the Checks Effects Interactions(CEI) pattern, creating a window for reentrancy.
An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious contract that repeatedly calls claimPrize within its receive function, allowing multiple claims before the status is updated.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe. It allows an attacker to:

- Claim the same prize multiple times.
- Drain more ETH from the contract than they are entitled to.
- Potentially empty the contract of all its ETH, affecting other users' prizes.

This could lead to significant financial losses for the protocol and undermine the integrity of the raffle system.

Function from Code(WinnablesPrizeManager.sol 105-125):
```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            NFTInfo storage raffle = _nftRaffles[raffleId];
            _nftLocked[raffle.contractAddress][raffle.tokenId] = false;
            _sendNFTPrize(raffle.contractAddress, raffle.tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            TokenInfo storage raffle = _tokenRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _tokensLocked[raffle.tokenAddress] -= raffle.amount; }
            _sendTokenPrize(raffle.tokenAddress, raffle.amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= _ethRaffles[raffleId]; }
            _sendETHPrize(_ethRaffles[raffleId], msg.sender);
        } else revert InvalidRaffle();
        

         // checks and status update occur after the external call


        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, implement the following changes:
- Implement a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard or a similar mechanism.
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern strictly:
   - [ ] Perform all checks at the beginning of the function.
   - [ ] Update the contract state (including setting the prize status to CLAIMED) before making any external calls.


Here's an example of how the function could be refactored:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract WinnablesPrizeManager is ReentrancyGuard {

    function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external nonReentrant {
        RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
        
        if (msg.sender != rafflePrize.winner) revert UnauthorizedToClaim();
        if (rafflePrize.status == RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED) revert AlreadyClaimed();
        
        rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED;
        RaffleType raffleType = rafflePrize.raffleType;
        
        if (raffleType == RaffleType.ETH) {
            uint256 amount = _ethRaffles[raffleId];
            unchecked { _ethLocked -= amount; }
            _sendETHPrize(amount, msg.sender);
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.TOKEN) {
            // ... [token transfer logic]
        } else if (raffleType == RaffleType.NFT) {
            // ... [NFT transfer logic]
        } else {
            revert InvalidRaffle();
        }
        
        emit PrizeClaimed(raffleId, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
These changes ensure that the contract state is updated before any external calls are made, and the reentrancy guard prevents multiple entries into the function, effectively mitigating the reentrancy vulnerability.
