# Attackers can prevent admin from withdrawing Link or any ERC20 tokens in the contract due to use of wrong operator

## Summary
Attackers can prevent admin from withdrawing Link or any ERC20 tokens in the contract due to use of wrong operator

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin is able to withdraw the Link sent to the WinnablesTicketManager.sol contract as well as any other ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to it through the `withdrawTokens()` function:
```solidity
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
@>      if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
The issue here is in the **InsufficientBalance()** check, as seen above it checks `amount < balance` this means the amount must be strictly equal to the contract balance. This allows for attackers to frontrun the admin call to `withdrawTokens()` and deposit an insignificant amount(e.g 1wei) which would cause the admin transaction to revert preventing admin from withdrawing Link or any ERC20 tokens stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Attackers can prevent admin from withdrawing Link or any ERC20 tokens in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the operator from `<` to `>` to avoid strict equality check.
```diff
function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
+        if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
-        if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
