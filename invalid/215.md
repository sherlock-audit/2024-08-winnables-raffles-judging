# WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#claimPrize - User can double-claim the reward if a hard fork occurs

## Summary
User can double-claim the reward if a hard fork occurs

## Vulnerability Detail
If a hard fork occurs on the Ethereum Mainnet, the user can get his reward on both forked chains. This happens because there is no validation on the `chainId` and when a user is a winner nothing stops him from calling `claimPrize` on the old chain and the new forked one. Although he should receive his reward once, he will double-claim it.

## Impact
User can double-claim the reward

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cash the `chainId` in the constructor and check if the current `chainId` equals the cashed one inside `claimPrize`.
