# Raffle can be canceled even if minTicketsThreshold is reached

## Summary
WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle will allow anyone to cancel a raffle even if minTicketsThreshold is reached due to a bad comparission in WinnablesTicketManager::_checkShouldCancel  

## Vulnerability Detail  
The vulnerability reside in WinnablesTicketManager::_checkShouldCancel (called by WinnablesTicketManager::cancelRaffle).
This function returns that a raffle cannot be canceled if ticket's supply is greater than raffle.minTicketsThreshold, but if ticket's supply is equal to minTicketsThreshold it allows to be canceled.
This is because it doesnt take into account where the minTicketsThreshold is reached due to a bad comparission:
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    //...snippet
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached(); // <- bad comparission
}
```
So if raffle ends with minTicketsThreshold reached, still can be canceled by anyone breaking invariant defined in IWinnables's Raffle struct.


## Impact
Invariant breakage about raffle conditionals  
DoS when raffle reaches minTicketsThreshold

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change comparator in WinnablesTicketManager::_checkShouldCancel to greater or equal:
```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply >= raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();  //<- changed
}
