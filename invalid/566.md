# `_ccipReceive` in `WinnablesTicketManager` does not update the `RaffleStatus` to CANCELED.

## Summary
`_ccipReceive` in `WinnablesTicketManager` does not update the `RaffleStatus` to CANCELED, when `_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE`. This can lead to LINK tokens being wasted. Also, allows the winner to still be set, even after getting cancelled.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_ccipReceive` function:

```solidity
    function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
        (uint256 raffleId) = abi.decode(message.data, (uint256));
        if (_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE) {
            // The raffle cannot be created, send back a cancel message to unlock the prize
            _sendCCIPMessage(
                _senderAddress,
                message.sourceChainSelector,
                abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
            );
            return;
        }
        _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED;

        emit RafflePrizeLocked(
            message.messageId,
            message.sourceChainSelector,
            raffleId
        );
    }
```
When `(_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE)`, while a message is sent to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` to cancel the raffle, `_raffles[raffleId].status` is not set to `RaffleStatus.CANCELED`. This is problematic.

As it is not CANCELED, and if the status was IDLE originally, then someone can still call the `drawWinner` (given that `_checkShouldDraw` satisfies) function, which spends the LINK token to get a random number (an unwanted spend). After this `propagateRaffleWinner` is called which again spends LINK too to send a ccip message declaring the winner to the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract. 

The major problem here is even when the raffle is cancelled on the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract, a winner for that raffle can still be set in the contract. This allows a winner to get prizes for a cancelled raffle. When in fact, a cancelled raffle's funds must be refunded to the ticket holders. 

If the admin had to set the raffle status to `CANCELED` in`WinnablesTicketManager` contract , they can only do it through the `cancelRaffle` function, which again sends a CCIP message, leading to more unwanted spend/consumption of LINK tokens

## Impact
Unnecessary consumption of LINK tokens. Also, a winner can be set for a cancelled raffle.

## Recommendation
Add the following to the ccipReceive function:

```solidity
        if (_raffles[raffleId].status != RaffleStatus.NONE) {
            // The raffle cannot be created, send back a cancel message to unlock the prize
    -->  _raffles[raffleId].status = RaffleStatus.CANCELED;
            _sendCCIPMessage(
                _senderAddress,
                message.sourceChainSelector,
                abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED), raffleId)
            );
            return;
        }
```
