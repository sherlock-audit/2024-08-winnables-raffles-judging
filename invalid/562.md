# Unclaimed Prize Manipulation Leading to Indefinite Asset Lock

# Summary

The Winnables protocol suffers from a critical vulnerability where prizes from completed raffles can remain unclaimed indefinitely. This issue stems from the absence of a time-bound claiming mechanism and the inability to recover or reallocate prizes once a raffle has been fulfilled. As a result, a malicious winner could intentionally never claim their prize, effectively locking valuable assets (NFTs, tokens, or ETH) in the contract permanently.

# Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists in the interaction between the `WinnablesTicketManager` and `WinnablesPrizeManager` contracts. Once a raffle is completed and a winner is determined, there is no mechanism to force prize distribution or reallocate unclaimed prizes after a certain period.
In the `WinnablesPrizeManager` contract, the [`claimPrize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L103-L125) function allows winners to claim their prizes. However, there is no time limit for when this function can be called. Once a winner is determined, the prize remains claimable indefinitely. 

The [`_checkShouldCancel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L434-L442) function in `WinnablesTicketManager` cannot be used to recover assets once the raffle has been fulfilled. This function only allows cancellation when the raffle is in the IDLE state, which is no longer possible once a winner has been drawn.

```solidity
function _checkShouldCancel(uint256 raffleId) internal view {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    if (raffle.status == RaffleStatus.PRIZE_LOCKED) return;
    if (raffle.status != RaffleStatus.IDLE) revert InvalidRaffle();
    if (raffle.endsAt > block.timestamp) revert RaffleIsStillOpen();
    uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(raffleId);
    if (supply > raffle.minTicketsThreshold) revert TargetTicketsReached();
}
```

1. This function enforces the following conditions for cancellation:
    - The raffle status must be IDLE (not PRIZE_LOCKED, REQUESTED, FULFILLED, etc.)
    - The raffle end time must have passed
    - The number of tickets sold must be less than the minimum threshold
2. Now, let's look at the raffle lifecycle in `WinnablesTicketManager`:
NONE -> PRIZE_LOCKED -> IDLE -> REQUESTED -> FULFILLED -> PROPAGATED
3. The `drawWinner` function changes the status from IDLE to REQUESTED:

```solidity
function drawWinner(uint256 raffleId) external {
    Raffle storage raffle = _raffles[raffleId];
    _checkShouldDraw(raffleId);
    raffle.status = RaffleStatus.REQUESTED;
    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```

1. The `fulfillRandomWords` function changes the status from REQUESTED to FULFILLED:

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(
    uint256 requestId,
    uint256[] memory randomWords
) internal override {
    // ...
    raffle.status = RaffleStatus.FULFILLED;
    // ...
}
```

1. Once the status is FULFILLED or beyond, the `_checkShouldCancel` function will revert with `InvalidRaffle()`, preventing cancellation.

# Impact

- Asset Lock: Valuable assets (NFTs, tokens, or ETH) could be permanently locked in the contract if a winner decides not to claim their prize.
- Protocol Dysfunction: Over time, a significant portion of the protocol's assets could become inaccessible, hampering its ability to conduct future raffles.
- User Trust: The inability to resolve unclaimed prizes could lead to a loss of user trust in the protocol.
- Economic Loss: The protocol and its users suffer economic losses from the permanent locking of assets.

Manual Review

# Recommendation

- Implement a Time-Bound Claiming Mechanism: Add a claiming deadline to each raffle. For example:

```solidity
struct RafflePrize {
    RaffleType raffleType;
    RafflePrizeStatus status;
    address winner;
    uint256 claimDeadline;
}

function claimPrize(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    require(block.timestamp <= rafflePrize.claimDeadline, "Claim period expired");
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

- Add a Prize Reallocation Function: Create a function that allows reallocation of unclaimed prizes after the deadline:

```solidity
function reallocateUnclaimedPrize(uint256 raffleId) external onlyRole(0) {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    require(block.timestamp > rafflePrize.claimDeadline, "Claim period not expired");
    require(rafflePrize.status != RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED, "Prize already claimed");
    
    // Logic to reallocate the prize (e.g., to a community fund or next raffle)
    // ...

    rafflePrize.status = RafflePrizeStatus.REALLOCATED;
    emit PrizeReallocated(raffleId);
}
```

- Implement Automatic Prize Distribution: Consider adding a function that automatically attempts to send the prize to the winner's address after a certain period:

```solidity
function attemptAutomaticDistribution(uint256 raffleId) external {
    RafflePrize storage rafflePrize = _rafflePrize[raffleId];
    require(block.timestamp > rafflePrize.claimDeadline, "Claim period not expired");
    require(rafflePrize.status != RafflePrizeStatus.CLAIMED, "Prize already claimed");

    // Attempt to send prize to winner
    // If fails, mark for manual intervention
}
```

- Update Cross-Chain Logic: Ensure that the cross-chain communication logic (using Chainlink CCIP) is updated to handle these new prize management scenarios.
