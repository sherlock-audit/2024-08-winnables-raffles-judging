# Incorrect check in `WinnablesTicketManager::withdrawTokens()` prevents partial withdrawals of tokens

## Summary

The `withdrawTokens` function in `WinnablesTicketManager.sol` contains an incorrect balance check that restricts withdrawals to only the entire token balance, rather than allowing partial withdrawals. The function reverts when `amount` is less than the `balance`, preventing any partial withdrawals. While this might seems appropriate for withdrawing all of the accidentally sent tokens, the logic blocks the partial withdrawal of LINK tokens, which the contract is expected to hold.
The sponsor clarified the intended behavior with the following comment:: *The function should also allow us to withdraw some of the LINK that the contract holds (the contract is expected to hold LINK tokens in order to pay for CCIP messaging)*

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of the issue lies in the condition check at [line 295](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/e8b0603f6a155c7505dacc77194ae6789d0dbe7a/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicketManager.sol#L295), which incorrectly reverts the transaction with `InsufficientBalance()` if the amount to withdraw is less than the contract's token balance. The following example demonstrates the issue with partial withdrawals:
1. The contract holds 1000 LINK tokens.
2. The admin attempts to withdraw 50 LINK tokens by calling `withdrawTokens` with `amount = 50e18`
3. The function reverts due to the incorrect check:
```solidity
if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
```
## Impact

The issue prevents partial withdrawals, restricting token withdrawals to only the full balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the condition check to:
```diff
    /// @notice (Admin) Withdraw Link or any ERC20 tokens accidentally sent here
    /// @param tokenAddress Address of the token contract
    function withdrawTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(0) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-       if (amount < balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
+       if (amount > balance) revert InsufficientBalance();
        token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
