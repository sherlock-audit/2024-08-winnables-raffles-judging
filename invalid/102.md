# Potential underflow for will DoS the WinnablePrizeManager contract.

## Summary

The `_ethLocked` variable in the `WinnablePrizeManager` contract could potentially underflow due to the re-entrancy issue in the `claimPrize` function, resulting in some functions unavailable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimPrize` function in the `WinnablePrizeManager` contract subtracts from the `_ethLocked` variable within an unchecked block before calling the `_senETHPrize` function to distribute the `ETH` raffle rewards using the low level call. However, a malicious contract could re-enter the `claimPrize` function via its fallback function before the raffle's status is marked as `CLAIMED`, resulting the `_ethLocked` becomes very large due to the underflow.

## Impact

Due to the underflow issue, the contract's state may become incorrect, leading to unexpected results. For instance, the `lockETH` function could be subjected to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due the `InvalidPrize` error.

Add reentrancy guard for the claimPrize fucntion or apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions principle.
