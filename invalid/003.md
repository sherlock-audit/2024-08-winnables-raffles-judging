# Prize NFTs could be lost

### Summary

The WinnablesPrizeManager contract uses the transferFrom method to transfer NFTs to the winner. However, this approach can lead to NFTs getting stuck if the recipient is a smart contract that is not capable of receiving NFTs. To ensure proper handling of NFTs and to avoid potential loss of assets, it is recommended to use the safeTransferFrom method instead.

Using transferFrom instead of safeTransferFrom can result in NFTs being transferred to contracts that do not support receiving ERC-721 tokens. In such cases, the NFT may become inaccessible, leading to asset loss.
