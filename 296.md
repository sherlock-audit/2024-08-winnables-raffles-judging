# potential replay of provisioned signature during `buyTickets` function - 0XALIYAH

## Summary
0xaliyah
arabgodx
1. The `buyTickets` function is vulnerable to a signature replay attack, which could allow an attacker to purchase tickets multiple times using a single valid signature. This could lead to a centralisation risk, where a single entity accumulates a disproportionate amount of control over the outcome of the raffle.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The vulnerability occurs because the `buyTickets` function does not properly handle the signature after it is verified. Specifically, the signature is not destroyed or invalidated after it is used to purchase tickets, which allows an attacker to reuse the same signature multiple times. 

Internal Preconditions:

1. Signature verification: The signature verification must be flawed, allowing an attacker to reuse a valid signature multiple times.
2. Lack of signature tracking: The system must not keep track of used signatures, or the tracking mechanism must be flawed, allowing an attacker to reuse a signature that has already been used.

Attack Vector:

1. Initial Transaction: The attacker sends a valid transaction with a legitimate signature to the network, which is included in a block.
2. Signature Replay: The attacker reuses the same signature to send a new transaction with an identical payload to the network.
3. Block Inclusion: The new transaction with the replayed signature is included in the same block as the initial transaction.
4. Double Spend: The attacker attempts again and again with a fresh payable value each time and buys countless times with the same valid signature on the same block.

Possible Outcomes:

1. Replayed Signature Success: When the network accepts the replayed transaction, the attacker successfully double-spends the signature, potentially causing centralisation, or causing the email, Discord verification, or KYC infrastructures to collapse under invalidation.

External Preconditions:

1. Obtaining a valid signature: The attacker must be able to obtain a valid signature, either by generating one using a designated signature generation process valid for 1 block only.
2. Protocol design spec: The protocol team are declaring for now that there is email verification, and linking discord, for each participant. After a certain level of activity KYC will be a further requirement. 

## Impact
1. LOW IMPACT + HIGH LIKELIHOOD OWASP
2. An attacker could use this vulnerability to accumulate a large number of tickets, also potentially bypassing the minimum ticket holder requirement and winning the raffle. This could lead to a centralisation of the protocol, where a single entity has a disproportionate amount of control over the outcome of the raffle.
3. Additional participants who have valid signature for the specific block will experience DOS if the attacker uses up all the raffle allocation for themselves erroneously. If that is the case the impact may also be valid medium due to as it impacts the availability of a time-sensitive function.
4. It may be possible that a winner will be selected from this faulty raffle if nothing else is broken.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. To fix this vulnerability, the `buyTickets` function should be modified to properly handle the signature after it is verified. Specifically, the signature should be destroyed or invalidated after it is used to purchase tickets.
