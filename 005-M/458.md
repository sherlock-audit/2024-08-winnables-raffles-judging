# Malicious attacker will be able to decide the raffle winner and claim the prize

### Summary

Incorrect handling of chainSelector in BaseCCIPContract.sol can cause incorrect raffle winners as attacker can spoof himself as WinnablesTicketManager.sol and choose the raffle winners.

### Root Cause

In `BaseCCIPContract.sol:43` the chainSelector variable is ignored because of an incorrect typecasting. Whatever the chainSelector value be, when executing `uint256(chainSelector << 160 )` the result is always 0. This causes _ccipContracts to not be able to differentiate a message coming from any chain, as long as the address is the same.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Attacker should have control over the address(WinnablesTicketManager.sol) in any other chain.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sends a ccip message to the WinnablesPrizeManager.sol with source_address = address(WinnablesTicketManager.sol) but from a different chain. This message would contain the following data and the chainSelector:
```solidity
Client.EVM2AnyMessage data = EVM2AnyMessage {
    receiver : address(WinnablesPrizeManager.sol) 
    data : abi.encodePacked(uint8(CCIPMessageType.WINNER_DRAWN), raffleId, winner)
    tokenAmounts :  // NOT IMPORTANT FOR ATTACK PATH
    feeToken :  // NOT IMPORTANT FOR ATTACK PATH
    extraArgs : "" // NOT IMPORTANT FOR ATTACK PATH
  }
```
Here it is important to note that the attacker can decide on the `winner` and `raffleId`.

2. The ccip calls the _ccipReceive function in the WinnablesPrizeManager.sol which does the following:
```solidity
function _ccipReceive(
        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
    ) internal override {
        (address _senderAddress) = abi.decode(message.sender, (address));
        bytes32 counterpart = _packCCIPContract(_senderAddress, message.sourceChainSelector);
        if (!_ccipContracts[counterpart]) revert UnauthorizedCCIPSender();
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L260-L278)
The `_senderAddress` extracted will be address(WinnablesTicketManager.sol), and then the `counterpart` is calculated as follows:
```solidity
function _packCCIPContract(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) internal pure returns(bytes32) {
        return bytes32(
            uint256(uint160(contractAddress)) |
            uint256(chainSelector << 160)
        );
}
```
Here whatever the chain the attacker is sending from, this resolves to "0" (first 96 bits will be 0).
And when the _ccipReceive function checks this calculated `counterpart` in the _ccipContracts, it will return true. This is because the admin must have added the WinnablesTicketManager.sol to the _ccipContracts. (and the chainSelector is ignored, so attackers message is flagged as correct).


3. The _ccipReceive function in WinnablesPrizeManager.sol then sets the winner as described by the attacker.
```solidity
CCIPMessageType messageType = CCIPMessageType(uint8(message.data[0]));
uint256 raffleId;
address winner;
if (messageType == CCIPMessageType.RAFFLE_CANCELED) {
            raffleId = _decodeRaffleCanceledMessage(message.data);
            _cancelRaffle(raffleId);
            return;
}
(raffleId, winner) = _decodeWinnerDrawnMessage(message.data);
_rafflePrize[raffleId].winner = winner;
emit WinnerPropagated(raffleId, winner);
```
4. The attacker can then go on to claim the prize of the raffle.

Note: This just shows the path where the attacker wins the raffle, he can also cancel the raffle. Also by impersonating WinnablesPrizeManager he can send cross chain messages to the WinnablesTicketManager to change the status of the raffle.

Note The chainselector is rendered obsolete in the _ccipContracts

### Impact

There are many attack paths that the attacker can employ one of them being choosing the winner for himself. This alone leads to 100% loss of funds and the other users losing unfairly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the _packCCIPContract as follows:
```solidity
function _packCCIPContract(address contractAddress, uint64 chainSelector) internal pure returns(bytes32) {
        return bytes32(
            uint256(uint160(contractAddress)) |
            (uint256(chainSelector) << 160) // typecasting chainSelector before left shifting
        );
}
```
