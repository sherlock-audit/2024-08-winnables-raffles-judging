# last raffle ticker buyer will never win the raffle

### Summary

Getting the winningNumber with `uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply;` guarantees that the last buyer of the raffle `supplies - > _supplied[raffleId]` never win because `%` will only choose from 0 to (supply - 1).

### Root Cause

In `WinnablesTicketManager.sol:_getWinnerByRequestId` the winning Number is gotten by getting the supply of the `WinnablesTicket` contract and doing a % operation on it but forgetting the last ticket.

```solidity
uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(request.raffleId);
        uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply;
```

This ensures the last raffle ticket before the draw matching the supply number is not considered and if
`request.randomWord ==  (supply) n` the first raffle buyer will be chosen.

The first raffle buyer has 2ce the chance of others to win the raffle and the last ticket holder has 0% chance of winning the raffle

### Internal pre-conditions

`propagateRaffleWinner` has to be called

### External pre-conditions

Chainlink VRF has to return `request.randomWord == (supply)N`, where N is a multiplier of supply

### Attack Path

`WinnablesTicketManager:fulfillRandomWords -> WinnablesTicketManager:propagateRaffleWinner -> WinnablesTicketManager:_getWinnerByRequestId`
### Impact

Last raffle ticket holder loses out on a chance to win the raffle and first ticket holder has a higher chance of winning the raffle, making the raffle skewed and unfair.

```solidity
function _getWinnerByRequestId(uint256 requestId) internal view returns(address) {
        RequestStatus storage request = _chainlinkRequests[requestId];
        uint256 supply = IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).supplyOf(request.raffleId);
        uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % supply;
        return IWinnablesTicket(TICKETS_CONTRACT).ownerOf(request.raffleId, winningTicketNumber);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Replace with `uint256 winningTicketNumber = request.randomWord % (supply +1);`
