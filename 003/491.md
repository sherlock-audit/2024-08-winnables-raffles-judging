# NFT Prize may be locked if the winner address is a contract

### Summary

Certain NFT's have logic inside the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in the transferFrom() function. [OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) advices to use the safeTransfer function instead of the transfer.

### Root Cause

Since any NFT can be used here, an NFT that triggers the onERC721Received() function is also in scope. An example of such an NFT is:  https://github.com/sz-piotr/eth-card-game/blob/master/src/ethereum/contracts/ERC721Market.sol#L20-L31 . 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Only certain NFT's are affected by this.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls the claimPrize for a raffle with NFT as the prize. which calls the _sendNFTPrize function

```solidity
function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
        IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
}
```

### Impact

If the winner is a contract, this could lead to a loss of funds for him.

### Mitigation

Use `safeTransferfrom()` instead of trasnferFrom
