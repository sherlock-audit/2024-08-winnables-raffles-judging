# Usage of `ERC721::transferFrom` function could lead to stuck NFT

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `WinnablesPrizeManager::claimPrize` is used to send the prize for a Raffle to its winner. The prize could be either an NFT, ERC20 tokens or Native ETH. In the case of an NFT, when `claimPrize` is called, the function calls the `internal` function `_sendNFTPrize`, which uses the `ERC721::transferFrom` for sending the NFT:

```javascript
    function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
        IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
    }
```

However, when using `transferFrom` there is the potential change of the NFT getting stuck in the protocol if the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721.

## Impact
Winner's prize could be stuck in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransferFrom()` when sending out the NFT as a prize to the winner

```diff
    function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
-       IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
+       IERC721(nft).safeTransferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
    }
```
