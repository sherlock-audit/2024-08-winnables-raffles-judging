# `WinnablesPrizeManager` cannot receive NFTs as intended

## Summary

`WinnablesPrizeManager` contract is designed to lock NFTs as rewards for raffles using the `lockNFT` function. However, the contract currently does not implement the necessary methods to handle the receipt of ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens - `onERC721Received()` and `onERC1155Received()` functions. As a result, the contract cannot properly receive and manage NFTs sent via `safeTransferFrom` method from other contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `lockNFT` function is used by admin to lock an NFT as a prize for a raffle. For this function to work correctly, the contract must be able to receive NFTs, which requires implementing the `onERC721Received()` function for ERC721 tokens and `onERC1155Received()` for ERC1155 tokens.
Meaning that if an NFT is transfered to the `WinablesPrizeManager` contract using the `safeTransferFrom` method the transfer will fail.

## Impact

Inability to receive ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens sended throug `safeTransferFrom` method.
