# ERC721 cannot be sent to the PrizeManager via safeTransfer functions

## Summary
`WinnablesPrizeManager` is intended to hold prize items. However, because it does not implement the `onERC721Received()` function, it will not pass the checks for `safeTransferFrom()` and will not be able to be used for NFTs as intended. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As it is currently implemented the WinnablePrizeManager won't be able to receive NFTs sent by `safeTransfer`, `safeTransferFrom`,  and  `safeMint` because it doesn't implement the necessary

## Impact
Any time an ERC721 reward token is attempted to be transferred to the WinnablePrizeManager with a safe function it will revert

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include `onERC721Received()` functions in `WinnablesPrizeManager.sol`.

### Note 
If ERC1155 are implemented in the future for rewards include the `onERC1155Received()` function
