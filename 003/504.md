# `_sendNFTPrize` does not checks if the token is sent

## Summary
The `_sendNFTPrize` function uses `transferFrom` without ensuring that the recipient can handle `ERC721` tokens, potentially leading to the NFT being locked in contracts that donâ€™t implement `onERC721Received`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_sendNFTPrize` function is using `transferFrom` to send `ERC721` tokens:

[WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L300-L302](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/main/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L300-L302)
```solidity
    function _sendNFTPrize(address nft, uint256 tokenId, address winner) internal {
        IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), winner, tokenId);
    }
```


If the winner is a contract that does not handle `ERC721` correctly, the token could end up locked in the receiving contract. 


## Impact
A contract winner could have the winning NFT locked in their contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Using `safeTransferFrom` would mitigate the issue and allow any contract to signal that they are correctly handling ERC721 tokens by implementing `onERC721Received`.
