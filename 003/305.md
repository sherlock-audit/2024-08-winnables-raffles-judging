# The WinnablesPrizeManager  is incompatible with  ERC721 transfer safe variants

### Summary

The PrizeManager contract doesn't implement the [IERC721Receiver](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) which makes it imcompatible to receive Fungible tokens sent using safeTransfer , SafetransferFrom.
## Target Contract
[WinnablePrizeManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-winnables-raffles/blob/81b28633d0f450e33a8b32976e17122418f5d47e/public-contracts/contracts/WinnablesPrizeManager.sol#L18)

### Root Cause
This  incompatibility sterns from  the absence of the *onERC721Received()* method(Which basically checks that the receiver is capable of handling the incoming tokens).Of course a walk around could be to strictly use transfer , transferFrom methods but just to cover any scenario whereby the sender uses the safeTransfer method it would be nice to ensure full compatibilty to the ERC721 methods.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-  Scenarios whereby Non-fungible tokens are sent from a contract or an EOA using  the transfer,transfer-from  safe variants.

### Impact

- The Transaction would always revert because the safety checks  aren't present.
i.e.
``` solidity
 onERC721Received()

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

*Implement the IERC721Receiver on the prizeManager*
