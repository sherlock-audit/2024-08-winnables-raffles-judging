# Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` for ERC721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()` when transferring ERC721s
## Vulnerability Detail
[OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()` use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
## Impact
In the functions shown at below, `ERC721` token is sent to `msg.sender` with the `transferFrom` method.
If this `msg.sender` is a contract and is not aware of incoming `ERC721` tokens, the sent token could be locked up in the contract forever.
