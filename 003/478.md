# NFT can be stuck in winner contract if contract doesn't have NFT handling logic

## Summary

If winner contract of NFT raffle dont hold NFT handling logic then winning NFT will stuck in winner contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a raffle is created with NFT as a prize and if a contract is the winner of that raffle then that contract must have NFT handling logic to handle the winning NFT.

In `WinnablesPrizeManager:withdrawNFT` to tranfser the NFT to winner `transferFrom` of IERC721 is used which does not check that receiving contract have any NFT handling logic or not.

Here is the flow:
- Raffle is created with NFT as a prize to winner.
- winner is a contract.
- winner contract does not have NFT handling logic
- winner contract calls `WinnablesPrizeManager:withdrawNFT`.
- NFT will be transfered to winner contract but absense of NFT handling logic leads to stuck NFT in winner contract.

## Impact

Loss of NFT in case of winner contract not having NFT handling logic.

```diff
function withdrawNFT(address nft, uint256 tokenId) external onlyRole(0) {
        if (_nftLocked[nft][tokenId]) revert NFTLocked();
+       IERC721(nft).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
-       IERC721(nft).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
```

| **Recipient Contract Handling** | Does not check if the recipient is a contract or whether the contract can handle ERC-721 tokens. | Checks if the recipient is a smart contract, and if so, calls `onERC721Received` to confirm the contract can handle ERC-721 tokens. |
