# WinnablesPrizeManager.sol is susceptible to signature replay attacks in the case of a hard fork

## Summary
In the case of a hard fork, all signed permits from Ethereum mainnet can be replayed on the forked chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue revolves around the potential for a user to double-claim a reward by claimPrize() function, if a hard fork occurs on the Ethereum Mainnet. A hard fork splits the blockchain into two separate chains, each with its own state and history. If a user is entitled to claim a prize, they can potentially do so on both chains, if the smart contract does not enforce validation on the chainId.

## Impact
Users can exploit the system and receive rewards twice, which they are not entitled to

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that any logic that should be specific to a single chain (e.g., payouts, rewards) includes proper 'chainId' checks, by dynamically checking the chainId, rather than relying on a static value to prevent exploits across different chains or forks.
