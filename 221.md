### Summary

 Potential for Fee Sniping Attacks (The contract does not have a mechanism to prevent front-running or fee sniping)

### Root Cause

 - Lines Involved: 56 - 61
- Input Values: The fee configurations and fallback Wei per Unit Link

 An attacker can submit a request right before the victim's request, paying the same or higher fees, thus pushing the victim's request back in the queue.
   

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Monitor current trasaction 
2. Define transaction in queue target
3. execute transaction with major fee value

### Impact

 A malicious user can repeatedly front-run and outbid other users, artificially increasing their transaction priority and potentially denying service to others.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism that prevents fee sniping, such as first-in-first-served (FIFS) ordering or dynamic fee bidding with an anti-sniping buffer.
